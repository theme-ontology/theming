:: Description
The Decameron (/dɪˈkæmərən/; Italian: Decameron [deˈkaːmeron, dekameˈrɔn,
-ˈron] or Decamerone [dekameˈroːne]), subtitled Prince Galehaut (Old Italian:
Prencipe Galeotto [ˈprentʃipe ɡaleˈɔtto, ˈprɛn-]) and sometimes nicknamed
l'Umana commedia ("the Human comedy", as it was Boccaccio that dubbed Dante
Alighieri's Comedy "Divine"), is a collection of novellas by the 14th-century
Italian author Giovanni Boccaccio (1313–1375). The book is structured as a
frame story containing 100 tales told by a group of seven young women and
three young men; they shelter in a secluded villa just outside Florence in
order to escape the Black Death, which was afflicting the city. Boccaccio
probably conceived of The Decameron after the epidemic of 1348, and completed
it by 1353. The various tales of love in The Decameron range from the erotic
to the tragic. Tales of wit, practical jokes, and life lessons contribute to
the mosaic. In addition to its literary value and widespread influence (for
example on Chaucer's Canterbury Tales), it provides a document of life at the
time. Written in the vernacular of the Florentine language, it is considered a
masterpiece of classical early Italian prose.
