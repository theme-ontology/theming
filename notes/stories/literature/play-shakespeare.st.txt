play: The Taming of the Shrew (1592)
====================================

:: Title
The Taming of the Shrew

:: Date
1592

:: Description
The Taming of the Shrew is a comedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have
been written between 1590 and 1592. The play begins with a framing device,
often referred to as the induction,[a] in which a mischievous nobleman tricks
a drunken tinker named Christopher Sly into believing he is actually a
nobleman himself. The nobleman then has the play performed for Sly's
diversion.

The main plot depicts the courtship of Petruchio and Katherina, the
headstrong, obdurate shrew. Initially, Katherina is an unwilling participant
in the relationship; however, Petruchio "tames" her with various psychological
torments, such as keeping her from eating and drinking, until she becomes a
desirable, compliant, and obedient bride. The subplot features a competition
between the suitors of Katherina's younger sister, Bianca, who is seen as the
"ideal" woman. The question of whether the play is misogynistic has become the
subject of considerable controversy, particularly among modern scholars,
audiences, and readers.

William Shakespeare—possibly in collaboration with Christopher Marlowe and
Thomas Nashe—believed to have been written in 1591. It is set during the
lifetime of King Henry VI of England.

Whereas Henry VI, Part 2 deals with the King's inability to quell the
bickering of his nobles and the inevitability of armed conflict and Henry VI,
Part 3 deals with the horrors of that conflict, Henry VI, Part 1 deals with
the loss of England's French territories and the political machinations
leading up to the Wars of the Roses, as the English political system is torn
apart by personal squabbles and petty jealousy.

play: The Two Gentlemen of Verona (1593)
========================================

:: Title
The Two Gentlemen of Verona

:: Date
1593

:: Description
The Two Gentlemen of Verona is a comedy by William Shakespeare, believed to
have been written between 1589 and 1593. It is considered by some to be
Shakespeare's first play,[a] and is often seen as showing his first tentative
steps in laying out some of the themes and motifs with which he would later
deal in more detail; for example, it is the first of his plays in which a
heroine dresses as a boy. The play deals with the themes of friendship and
infidelity, the conflict between friendship and love, and the foolish
behaviour of people in love. The highlight of the play is considered by some
to be Launce, the clownish servant of Proteus, and his dog Crab, to whom "the
most scene-stealing non-speaking role in the canon" has been attributed.

play: Henry VI Part 2 (1594)
============================

:: Title
Henry VI, Part 2

:: Date
1594

:: Description
Henry VI, Part 2 (often written as 2 Henry VI) is a history play by William
Shakespeare believed to have been written in 1591 and set during the lifetime
of King Henry VI of England. Whereas Henry VI, Part 1 deals primarily with the
loss of England's French territories and the political machinations leading up
to the Wars of the Roses, and Henry VI, Part 3 deals with the horrors of that
conflict, 2 Henry VI focuses on the King's inability to quell the bickering of
his nobles, the death of his trusted adviser Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, the
rise of the Duke of York and the inevitability of armed conflict. As such, the
play culminates with the opening battle of the War, the First Battle of St
Albans (1455).

Although the Henry VI trilogy may not have been written in chronological
order, the three plays are often grouped together with Richard III to form a
tetralogy covering the entire Wars of the Roses saga, from the death of Henry
V in 1422 to the rise to power of Henry VII in 1485. It was the success of
this sequence of plays that firmly established Shakespeare's reputation as a
playwright.

play: The Comedy of Errors (1595)
=================================

:: Title
The Comedy of Errors

:: Date
1595

:: Description
The Comedy of Errors is one of William Shakespeare's early plays. It is his
shortest and one of his most farcical comedies, with a major part of the
humour coming from slapstick and mistaken identity, in addition to puns and
word play. The Comedy of Errors is, along with The Tempest, one of only two
Shakespearean plays to observe the Aristotelian principle of unity of
time—that is, that the events of a play should occur over 24 hours. It has
been adapted for opera, stage, screen and musical theatre numerous times
worldwide. In the centuries following its premiere, the play's title has
entered the popular English lexicon as an idiom for "an event or series of
events made ridiculous by the number of errors that were made throughout".

Henry IV, Part 2

:: Date

:: Description
Henry IV, Part 2 is a history play by William Shakespeare believed to have
been written between 1596 and 1599. It is the third part of a tetralogy,
preceded by Richard II and Henry IV, Part 1 and succeeded by Henry V.

The play is often seen as an extension of aspects of Henry IV, Part 1, rather
than a straightforward continuation of the historical narrative, placing more
emphasis on the highly popular character of Falstaff and introducing other
comic figures as part of his entourage, including Ancient Pistol, Doll
Tearsheet, and Justice Robert Shallow. Several scenes specifically parallel
episodes in Part 1.

Falstaff, the fat knight who had previously been featured in Henry IV, Part 1
and Part 2. It has been adapted for the opera at least ten times. The play is
one of Shakespeare's lesser-regarded works among literary critics.

play: Measure for Measure (1604)
================================

:: Title
Measure for Measure

:: Date
1604

:: Description
Measure for Measure is a play by William Shakespeare, believed to have been
written in 1603 or 1604. Originally published in the First Folio of 1623,
where it was listed as a comedy, the play's first recorded performance
occurred in 1604. The play's main themes include justice, "morality and mercy
in Vienna", and the dichotomy between corruption and purity: "some rise by
sin, and some by virtue fall". Mercy and virtue prevail, as the play does not
end tragically, with virtues such as compassion and forgiveness being
exercised at the end of the production. While the play focuses on justice
overall, the final scene illustrates that Shakespeare intended for moral
justice to temper strict civil justice: a number of the characters receive
understanding and leniency, instead of the harsh punishment to which they,
according to the law, could have been sentenced.

Measure for Measure is often called one of Shakespeare's problem plays. It
continues to be classified as a comedy, although its tone sometimes defies
this classification.

play: Antony and Cleopatra (1607)
=================================

:: Title
Antony and Cleopatra

:: Date
1607

:: Description
Antony and Cleopatra (First Folio title: The Tragedie of Anthonie, and
Cleopatra) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare. The play was first performed,
by the King's Men, at either the Blackfriars Theatre or the Globe Theatre in
around 1607; its first appearance in print was in the Folio of 1623.

The plot is based on Thomas North's 1579 English translation of Plutarch's
Lives (in Ancient Greek) and follows the relationship between Cleopatra and
Mark Antony from the time of the Sicilian revolt to Cleopatra's suicide during
the Final War of the Roman Republic. The major antagonist is Octavius Caesar,
one of Antony's fellow triumvirs of the Second Triumvirate and the first
emperor of the Roman Empire. The tragedy is mainly set in the Roman Republic
and Ptolemaic Egypt and is characterized by swift shifts in geographical
location and linguistic register as it alternates between sensual, imaginative
Alexandria and a more pragmatic, austere Rome.

play: Pericles Prince of Tyre (1609)
====================================

:: Title
Pericles, Prince of Tyre

:: Date
1609

:: Description
Pericles, Prince of Tyre is a Jacobean play written at least in part by
William Shakespeare and included in modern editions of his collected works
despite questions over its authorship, as it was not included in the First
Folio. Whilst various arguments support that Shakespeare is the sole author of
the play (notably DelVecchio and Hammond's Cambridge edition of the play),
modern editors generally agree that Shakespeare is responsible for almost
exactly half the play—827 lines—the main portion after scene 9 that follows
the story of Pericles and Marina. Modern textual studies indicate that the
first two acts of 835 lines detailing the many voyages of Pericles were
written by a collaborator, which strong evidence suggests to have been the
victualler, panderer, dramatist and pamphleteer George Wilkins.

leader Caius Marcius Coriolanus. It is one of the last two tragedies written
by Shakespeare, along with Antony and Cleopatra.

Coriolanus is the name given to a Roman general after his military success
against various uprisings challenging the government of Rome. Following this
success, Coriolanus becomes active in politics and seeks political leadership.
His temperament is unsuited for popular leadership and he is quickly deposed,
whereupon he aligns himself to set matters straight according to his own will.
The alliances he forges along the way result in his ultimate downfall.

first three acts are filled with intense psychological drama, while the last
two acts are comic and supply a happy ending.

:: Title
The Tempest

:: Date
1611

:: Description
The Tempest is a play by William Shakespeare, probably written in 1610–1611,
and thought to be one of the last plays that Shakespeare wrote alone. After
the first scene, which takes place on a ship at sea during a tempest, the rest
of the story is set on a remote island, where the sorcerer Prospero, a complex
and contradictory character, lives with his daughter Miranda, and his two
servants—Caliban, a savage monster figure, and Ariel, an airy spirit. The play
contains music and songs that evoke the spirit of enchantment on the island.
It explores many themes, including magic, betrayal, revenge, and family. In
Act IV, a wedding masque serves as a play-within-the play, and contributes
spectacle, allegory, and elevated language.

Cymbeline, also known as The Tragedie of Cymbeline or Cymbeline, King of
Britain, is a play by William Shakespeare set in Ancient Britain (c. 10–14)[a]
and based on legends that formed part of the Matter of Britain concerning the
early Celtic British King Cunobeline. Although listed as a tragedy in the
First Folio, modern critics often classify Cymbeline as a romance or even a
comedy. Like Othello and The Winter's Tale, it deals with the themes of
innocence and jealousy. While the precise date of composition remains unknown,
the play was certainly produced as early as 1611.

Henry VIII is a collaborative history play, written by William Shakespeare and
John Fletcher, based on the life of Henry VIII. An alternative title, All Is
True, is recorded in contemporary documents, with the title Henry VIII not
appearing until the play's publication in the First Folio of 1623. Stylistic
evidence indicates that individual scenes were written by either Shakespeare
or his collaborator and successor, John Fletcher. It is also somewhat
characteristic of the late romances in its structure. It is noted for having
more stage directions than any of Shakespeare's other plays.
