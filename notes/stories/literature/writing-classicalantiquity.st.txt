writing: Orestia (458 BC)
=========================

:: Title
Oresteia

:: Date
458 BC

:: Description
The Oresteia (Ancient Greek: Ὀρέστεια) is a trilogy of Greek tragedies written
by Aeschylus in the 5th century BC, concerning the murder of Agamemnon by
Clytemnestra, the murder of Clytemnestra by Orestes, the trial of Orestes, the
end of the curse on the House of Atreus and the pacification of the Erinyes.
The trilogy—consisting of Agamemnon (Ἀγαμέμνων), The Libation Bearers
(Χοηφóρoι), and The Eumenides (Εὐμενίδες)—also shows how the Greek gods
interacted with the characters and influenced their decisions pertaining to
events and disputes. The only extant example of an ancient Greek theatre
trilogy, the Oresteia won first prize at the Dionysia festival in 458 BC. The
principal themes of the trilogy include the contrast between revenge and
justice, as well as the transition from personal vendetta to organized
litigation. Oresteia originally included a satyr play, Proteus (Πρωτεύς),
following the tragic trilogy, but all except a single line of Proteus has been
lost.

:: Choice Themes
killing wicked people [The social ethical dilemma at the heart of the story is whether a man may justly slay his own mother if she has killed his father. One argument against this was that husband and wife don't share blood whereas mother and son do; a counter argument was that a mother is merely a crucible for the father's seed and thus deserve far less loyalty from her offspring than do the father.]

:: Major Themes
matricide [The point of the story was to debate whether Orestes' slaying of his own mother could possibly be justified.]
spouse murder [The story concerned the murder of Agamemnon by Clytemnestra.]
the desire for vengeance [Electra and Orestes wanted to avenge their father Agamemnon's murder at the hands of Clytemnestra.]
the desire for justice [Apollo in particular was concerned with seeing justice visited on Clytemnestra; the Furies were keen on seeing Orestes suffer justice (as they saw it) for committing matricide.]
Ancient Greek mythology [Apollo, Athena, and the Furies made explicit appearances in part 3 and the morality of Orestes crime was debated with reference to things the Gods had done.]
mother and son [Clytemnestra and Orestes; Orestes occasionally reflected on his relationship to her]

:: Minor Themes
brother and sister [Orestes and Electra]
husband and wife [Agamemnon and Clytemnestra]
mother and daughter [Clytemnestra]

These exclusively male lunar inhabitants had numerous distinguishing physical characteristics, including beards growing from their knees, one toenail-less toe on each foot, cabbage-leaf tails, removable eyes, leaves for ears, a belly pocket used to keep children warm in cold weather, and artificial phalluses of ivory or wood. Their noses ran not with honey, and the sweated milk that could be made into a delectable cheese. They carried fetuses to term in a special womb contained in the calf. The rich among them wore garments made of a soft, malleable glass; the poor of a bronze fabric.]

what if I were trapped in the belly of a whale [After returning to Earth, Lucian and his crew of fellow adventurers were swallowed up by a 200-mile-long whale wherein they dwelt for a year and a month. Inside the leviathan, they discovered a wooded island inhabited by a man and his son, who lived under constant threat from wicked lobster-men and mermen.

the afterlife [After escaping from the belly of a leviathan, Lucian and his fellow adventurers soon came across the fabled Island of the Blessed: a paradise on Earth where heroes and select men of renown went after they died.

what it is like in a legal proceeding [Lucian and his fellow adventurers observed three trials on the Island of the Blessed as the awaited to be tried for coming to the island while still alive.
