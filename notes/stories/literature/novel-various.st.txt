:: Description
Journey to the Center of the Earth (French: Voyage au centre de la Terre),
also translated with the variant titles A Journey to the Centre of the Earth
and A Journey into the Interior of the Earth), is a classic science fiction
novel by Jules Verne. It was first published in French in 1864, then reissued
in 1867 in a revised and expanded edition. Professor Otto Lidenbrock is the
tale's central figure, an eccentric German scientist who believes there are
volcanic tubes that reach to the very center of the earth. He, his nephew
Axel, and their Icelandic guide Hans rappel into Iceland's celebrated inactive
volcano Snæfellsjökull, then contend with many dangers, including cave-ins,
subpolar tornadoes, an underground ocean, and living prehistoric creatures
from the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras. (The 1867 revised edition inserted
additional prehistoric material in Chaps. 37–39.) Eventually the three
explorers are spewed back to the surface by an active volcano, Stromboli, in
southern Italy.

:: Choice Themes
travel into the Earth [The whole story is about a trio of intrepid explorers who trek down old lava tubes to ultimately reach the center of the Earth.]

:: Major Themes
the thirst for knowledge [Professor Lidenbrock was driven by a desire to discover what lurked deep beneath the surface of the Earth. On the journey down, he comported himself in a single-minded and at times reckless manner so that he might satisfy his burning curiosity.]
uncle and nephew [Professor Lidenbrock and his nephew Alex explored the bowels of the Earth together.]
human vs. nature [Professor Lidenbrock, his nephew Alex, and their stoic Icelandic guide Hans contended with all types of dangers as they trekked down through an extinct volcano to the center of the Earth: the survived cave-ins, privation, tornadoes, a perilous voyage on a vast subsurface ocean, an encounter with a prehistoric sea creature, etc.]
Hollow Earth [Professor Lidenbrock and his party pointedly proved wrong the prevailing theory that the Earth had a central source of intense heat by the simple expedient of trekking down the lava tubes of an extinct volcano all the way to the center of the planet.]
geology [Professor Lidenbrock and his party commented upon numerous geological features on their trek down to the center of the Earth: Lidenbrock (and to a lesser extent Alex) relatively dated the geological strata they were passing through and examined their fossil contents, discussed about various minerals, entertained two opposing theories of what lay beneath the Earth, etc.]
academia [Professor Lidenbrock was a stereotypical oblivious German academic who was interested solely in advancing science by disproving the prevailing theory that the Earth had an intense source of heat at its center.]
the scientist profession [The trained geologist Professor Lidenbrock and his nephew protégé Alex were in their element as they explored the bowels of the Earth.]
human character [The party guide Hans was portrayed as a stoic Scandinavian to the extreme.]
risk taking vs. playing it safe [Professor Lidenbrock single-mindedly insisted that the party take big risks at every turn in an effort to reach the center of the Earth, while his nephew Alex constantly countered him with suggestions to take the cautious route - or else return home the same way they came.]
isolated prehistoric land [The party discovered a primeval region deep inside the Earth that was replete with prehistoric forests, creatures, and even hominids. In particular, the observed carboniferous-era vegetation, dinosaurs, and a prehistoric humanoid more than twelve feet in height who was watching over a herd of mastodons.]

:: Minor Themes
cryptographic cypher [Professor Lidenbrock and Alex broke Arne Saknussemm's variant on a transposition cipher to read the 16th century Icelandic alchemist's encrypted message describing how he'd made it to the center of the Earth and back.]
romantic love [Alex was mooning over his love interest, Gretchen.]
seasickness [Professor Lidenbrock suffered from this sickness on the voyage to Iceland to his embarrassment.]
heresy [Arne Saknussemm was persecuted for heresy in 1573 and his books burned.]
hunting [Hans was an eiderduck hunter by trade.]
hospitality [A peasant family welcomed Professor Lidenbrock and his party into their home and treated them like kings.]
human pleasure [Professor Lidenbrock and Alex waxed poetic at times about the wonders of nature they beheld while trekking through the bowels of the Earth.]
compassion [A nearly dying of thirst Alex was touched when the otherwise oblivious and hot-tempered Professor Lidenbrock showed him a modicum of compassion by addressing him as "Poor boy".]
solitary confinement as a punishment [A lost and alone Alex wondered to himself as to how many prisoners had gone mad from being locked up in solitary confinement.]
human in danger [Alex was lost alone for days in the bowels of the Earth.]
despair [Alex gave himself up for dead after wondering around alone in the bowels of the Earth for days on end, thinking he'd never find Professor Lidenbrock and Hans again.]
facing death [Days of wonder around alone in the bowels of the Earth left Alex thinking he was goner. Professor Lidenbrock and Alex thought they might well die at one point when they were in the process of being shot up out of a volcano.]
perilous voyage at sea [The party got caught in a severe lightning storm while traversing a vast subterranean in their makeshift raft.]
living dinosaur [The party witnessed an Ichthyosaurus battle and defeat a Plesiosaurus while traversing a vast subsurface ocean on their makeshift raft.]
electricity [Professor Lidenbrock and Alex were fascinated to find a genuine underground world that was lit by electrically charged gas near its ceiling.]
cryptid [The party spied a herd of supposedly extinct, prehistoric species of mastodon in the primeval subsurface forest.]
giant person [The party spied a more than 12-foot-tall prehistoric humanoid watching over a herd of mastodons.]


novel: Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas (1872)
====================================================

:: Title
Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas

:: Date
1872

:: Description
Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas (French: Vingt mille lieues sous les
mers) is a classic science fiction adventure novel by French writer Jules
Verne.

The novel was originally serialized from March 1869 through June 1870 in
Pierre-Jules Hetzel's fortnightly periodical, the Magasin d'éducation et de
récréation. A deluxe octavo edition, published by Hetzel in November 1871,
included 111 illustrations by Alphonse de Neuville and Édouard Riou. The book
was widely acclaimed on its release and remains so; it is regarded as one of
the premier adventure novels and one of Verne's greatest works, along with
Around the World in Eighty Days and Journey to the Center of the Earth. Its
depiction of Captain Nemo's underwater ship, the Nautilus, is regarded as
ahead of its time, since it accurately describes many features of today's
submarines, which in the 1860s were comparatively primitive vessels.

bird in a gilded cage [The Nautilus had everything the dedicated naturalist Professor Aronnax could ever want: a vast library that doubled as a smoking room, a lavishly adorned drawing room in which paintings of the great masters hung, glass cases full of specimens from the sea that no naturalist had ever beheld, etc. On top of all that the Nautilus was to Aronnax a dream vessel from which to conduct advanced marine research.]

master and servant [Professor Aronnax was accompanied by his loyal man-servant, Conseil, throughout the course of the story.]

That is until one special woman gave birth to everyone's astonishment. It was later determined that she had a mutation that enabled her to reproduce asexually.
