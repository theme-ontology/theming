guilt and evidence [when Azis is arrested Fielding struggles with the police and judicial system but encounters politics and poor attitude and Azis is just barely exonerated towards the end]
the British Raj [Underlying the whole story and sometimes discussed explicitly, is the righteousness of British rule in India at the time (1924) and the implications it has for Indian society (in spite of the indignity, did it perhaps unite India and bring it positive things?).]

female-only society [A trio of male explorers discovered an isolated land populated entirely by women who reproduce asexually.]

virgin birth [The genesis of Herland is this: All the men in a certain society perished in a volcanic cataclysm. Being unable to reproduce, the surviving women thought their society was at an end. That is until one special woman gave birth to everyone's astonishment. It was later determined that she had a mutation that enabled her to reproduce asexually. As if this in itself is not enough to justify this theme, let it be known that Ellador was told the story of the Mary's miraculous virgin birth by Van.]

Journey to the Center of the Earth (French: Voyage au centre de la Terre),

novel by Jules Verne. It was first published in French in 1864, then reissued
in 1867 in a revised and expanded edition. Professor Otto Lidenbrock is the
tale's central figure, an eccentric German scientist who believes there are
volcanic tubes that reach to the very center of the earth. He, his nephew
Axel, and their Icelandic guide Hans rappel into Iceland's celebrated inactive
volcano Snæfellsjökull, then contend with many dangers, including cave-ins,
subpolar tornadoes, an underground ocean, and living prehistoric creatures
from the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras. (The 1867 revised edition inserted
additional prehistoric material in Chaps. 37–39.) Eventually the three
explorers are spewed back to the surface by an active volcano, Stromboli, in
southern Italy.

uncle and nephew [Professor Lidenbrock and his nephew Alex explored the bowels of the Earth together.]
human vs. speculative environment <underground, prehistoric> [Professor Lidenbrock, his nephew Alex, and their stoic Icelandic guide Hans contended with all types of dangers as they trekked down through an extinct volcano to the center of the Earth: they survived cave-ins, privation, tornadoes, a perilous voyage on a vast subsurface ocean, and an encounter with a prehistoric sea creature, among other things.]
Hollow Earth [Professor Lidenbrock and his party pointedly proved wrong the prevailing theory that the Earth had a central source of intense heat by the simple expedient of trekking down the lava tubes of an extinct volcano all the way to the center of the planet.]
geology [Professor Lidenbrock and his party commented upon numerous geological features on their trek down to the center of the Earth: Lidenbrock (and to a lesser extent Alex) relatively dated the geological strata they were passing through and examined their fossil contents, discussed about various minerals, entertained two opposing theories of what lay beneath the Earth, etc.]

human character [The party guide Hans was portrayed as a stoic Scandinavian to the extreme.]

isolated prehistoric land [The party discovered a primeval region deep inside the Earth that was replete with prehistoric forests, creatures, and even hominids. In particular, the observed carboniferous-era vegetation, dinosaurs, and a prehistoric humanoid more than twelve feet in height who was watching over a herd of mastodons.]

compassion [A nearly dying of thirst Alex was touched when the otherwise oblivious and hot-tempered Professor Lidenbrock showed him a modicum of compassion by addressing him as "Poor boy".]
solitary confinement as a punishment [A lost and alone Alex wondered to himself as to how many prisoners had gone mad from being locked up in solitary confinement.]
human in danger [Alex was lost alone for days in the bowels of the Earth.]
despair [Alex gave himself up for dead after wondering around alone in the bowels of the Earth for days on end, thinking he'd never find Professor Lidenbrock and Hans again.]
facing death [Days of wonder around alone in the bowels of the Earth left Alex thinking he was goner. Professor Lidenbrock and Alex thought they might well die at one point when they were in the process of being shot up out of a volcano.]

living dinosaur [The party witnessed an Ichthyosaurus battle and defeat a Plesiosaurus while traversing a vast subsurface ocean on their makeshift raft.]

novel: Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas (1872)
====================================================

:: Title
Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas

:: Date
1872

:: Description
Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas (French: Vingt mille lieues sous les
mers) is a classic science fiction adventure novel by French writer Jules
Verne.

The novel was originally serialized from March 1869 through June 1870 in
Pierre-Jules Hetzel's fortnightly periodical, the Magasin d'éducation et de
récréation. A deluxe octavo edition, published by Hetzel in November 1871,
included 111 illustrations by Alphonse de Neuville and Édouard Riou. The book
was widely acclaimed on its release and remains so; it is regarded as one of
the premier adventure novels and one of Verne's greatest works, along with
Around the World in Eighty Days and Journey to the Center of the Earth. Its
depiction of Captain Nemo's underwater ship, the Nautilus, is regarded as
ahead of its time, since it accurately describes many features of today's
submarines, which in the 1860s were comparatively primitive vessels.

human vs. captivity [The trio of Professor Aronnax, Conseil, and Ned Land refused to accept that it was their shared fate to remain on board the Nautilus permanently. Although Aronnax felt conflicted about leaving his underwater prison on account of the unique opportunity it afforded him to conduct advanced marine research.]
bird in a gilded cage [The Nautilus had everything the dedicated naturalist Professor Aronnax could ever want: a vast library that doubled as a smoking room, a lavishly adorned drawing room in which paintings of the great masters hung, glass cases full of specimens from the sea that no naturalist had ever beheld, etc. On top of all that the Nautilus was to Aronnax a dream vessel from which to conduct advanced marine research.]
the thirst for knowledge [Professor Aronnax toured the ocean depths on a quest for scientific knowledge. Captain Nemo was partially motivated by scientific curiosity.]
master and servant [Professor Aronnax was accompanied by his loyal man-servant, Conseil, throughout the course of the story.]

We is set in the future. D-503, a spacecraft engineer, lives in the One State,
an urban nation constructed almost entirely of glass, which assists mass
surveillance. The structure of the state is Panopticon-like, and life is
scientifically managed F. W. Taylor-style. People march in step with each
other and are uniformed. There is no way of referring to people except by
their given numbers. The society is run strictly by logic or reason as the
primary justification for the laws or the construct of the society. The
individual's behaviour is based on logic by way of formulas and equations
outlined by the One State.
