:: Choice Themes
human parenting [The story concerned an argument between Demea and Micio regarding how one best goes about raising a son. Demea proved his point in the end that it is best to provide children with a strict upbringing. Micio spoke about a father's duty (p342). Syrus spoke of how Micio spoiled Micho's adoptive son, Aeschinus (p357).]
father and son [Much was made of Micio having given his adoptive son, Aeschinus, a lenient upbringing. Likewise for Demea having given his son, Ctesipho, a strict upbringing.]

:: Major Themes
brother and brother [The plot revolved around each of the two brothers Micio (an easy going man) and Demea (a strict authoritarian) trying to prove to the other that their own way of parenting was best. Aeschinus saved his brother Ctesipho from scandal by pretending it was he who'd been romantically involved with a lowly slave girl, and not Ctesipho as was actually the case.]
human characters in contrast [The easy going Micio was contrasted with his strict, authoritarian brother Demea.]
fatherly disappointment in a son [The story concerned Demea accusing his brother, Micio, of having spoiled Demea's own son, Ctesipho, whom Micio had been entrusted to raise. Demea in particular expressed disappointment over Ctesipho's part in the abduction (p355).]
uncle and nephew [Micio and Aeschinus. Micio and Ctesipho.]
master and slave [Demea interacted with his slave Dromo. Micio interacted with his slave Syrus. Sostrata and her slave Geta. Demea granted Micio's slave Syrus his freedom to Micio's surprise (p356).]

:: Minor Themes
carrot vs. stick [Micio explained that "a man won by kindness... stays the same whether he's with you or not", while a man won by "the threat of punishment alone" will "fall back to his old ways" once they have the chance (p342).]
the importance of reputation [Sostrata spoke of how her daughter Pamphila had no hope of getting married now that her reputation was ruined (p355).]
family honor [Ctesipho spoke of the disgrace that his romantic involvement with a lowly music girl would bring upon his family, according to the slave Syrus (p358).]
anger [Micio instructed Demea to control his temper after Demea exclaimed that Micio had corrupted both their sons (p377).]
human idea about life [Demea quoted Micio as saying that "the besetting fault of us all is that old age we think too much about money" (p384).]
remorse [Demea feigned regret over having raised his son, Ctesipho in an overly strict manner (p380). Aeschinus expressed regret to Micio (p371).]
creative writing [In the prologue the author explained some hows and whys of his writing in an attempt to put down various critics.]
neighbor and neighbor [Micio and his widowed neighbor Sostrata.]
slavery [Sannio the slave dealer and his activities were briefly, but explicitly, topical. Aeschinus held that a certain girl was freeborn and therefore should not be sold as a slave.]
theft [Sannio accused Aeschinus of stealing a slave girl.]
honesty [Hegio lamented Aeschinus' lack of honesty and gentlemanliness (p360).]
greed for riches [Demea feigned to regret having wasted his youth on "money-grubbing" (p380).]
uptight character vs. laid back character [Mici seemed laid back compared to Demea.]
infatuation [Ctesipho was besotted with the lowly lute-player Bacchis.]

play: Phormio (161 BC)
======================

:: Title
Phormio

:: Date
161 BC

:: Description
Phormio is a Latin comic play by the early Roman playwright Terence, based on
a now lost play by Apollodorus of Carystus entitled Epidikazomenos ("The
Claimant"). It is generally believed to be Terence's fourth play. It was first
performed at the Ludi Romani of 161 BC. Structurally, Phormio is considered to
be one of the best Roman comedies.

The plot is set in Athens, and revolves around the love affairs of two young
men, Phaedria and Antipho, who are cousins. Phaedria is in love with a harp-
player called Pamphila, but doesn't have the money to buy her from her owner
Dorio; Antipho wishes to marry a free but poor girl called Phanium, unaware
that she is in fact Phaedria's half sister as the result of an affair between
Phaedria's father Chremes and a Lemnian woman. By clever legal wrangling,
Phormio manages to help both young men to obtain their wishes, and in addition
extracts a large sum of money from the two fathers.

play: The Self-Tormentor (163 BC)
=================================

:: Title
The Self-Tormentor

:: Date
163 BC

:: Description
Heauton Timorumenos (Ἑαυτὸν τιμωρούμενος, Greek for The Self-Tormentor) is a
play written in Latin by Terence (Latin: Publius Terentius Afer), a dramatist
of the Roman Republic, in 163 BC. The play has presented academics with some
problems. Firstly it is not entirely clear whether Heauton Timorumenos is
Terence's second or third play. More importantly, due to the scant survival of
Menander's play of the same name, there is no simple way to judge how much of
Terence's version is translation and how much is invention. It is set in a
village in the countryside of Attica.
