===================================

:: Title
The Girl from Andros

:: Date
166 BC

:: Description
Andria (English: The Girl from Andros) is a Roman comedy adapted by Terence
from two Greek plays by Menander the first being Samia and the other being
Perinthia. It was the first play by Terence to be presented publicly, and was
performed in 166 BC during the Ludi Megalenses. It became the first of
Terence's plays to be performed post-antiquity, in Florence in 1476. It was
adapted by Machiavelli, whose Andria was likewise the author's first venture
into playwriting, and was the first of Terence's plays to be translated into
English ca. 1520. The second English translation was by the Welsh writer
Morris Kyffin in 1588.

:: Choice Themes
father and son [The story concerned conflict between Simo and his son Pamphilus regarding whom the latter should marry.]

:: Major Themes
fatherly disappointment in a son [Simo was upset at his son Pamphilus' behavior regarding Glycerium, and later for perceived lying and scheming.]
infatuation [Pamphilus and Glycerium were besotted with each other.]
master and slave [The story much concerned the scheming or perceived scheming of slaves, especially Davus, to manipulate their masters. Simo and his slave Sosia (latterly a freedman). Charinus and his slave Byrrhia. Pamphilus and his slave Davus.]
choosing between love and family [Pamphilus was torn between his love for Glycerium and his duty to his father.]
arranged marriage [Central to the story was that Simo had arranged a marriage for Pamhpilus that Pamphilus didn't care for. Chremes arranged two marriages for his daughters (Glycerium being deemed his in the end).]
friendship [Charinus was dismayed by the rumors that his dear friend Pamphilus was in love with the very girl whom Charinus fancied. Simo and his old friend Chremes came into conflict what should have been a routine arranged marriage between Simo's son and Chremes' daughter.]

:: Minor Themes
love vs. friendship [Pamphilus nearly fell out with Charinus because of romantic complications.]
father and daughter [Chremes and his daughter Philumena.]
male promiscuousness [Mysis complained to Lesbia about how men never stay faithful.]
lovers' quarrel [Charinus said "lovers' quarrels are renewal of love".]
keeping secrets [Mysis agree to keep secret Pamphilus' impending wedding ceremony from his lover Glycerium on account that news of the event might too much for the pregnant Glycerium to take.]
miserliness [Davus apparently reluctantly told Simo that Simo had a reputation for being tight with his money.]
mimetic desire [Charinus said "It was only after I told you I loved her that you took a fancy to her" to Pamphilus in regard to Charinus' love interest Philumena.]
class prejudice in society [Simo disapproved over his son, Pamphilus, dallying with a woman of such apparent low birth as Glycerium, who it seemed was the sister of a harlot.]
moderation in all things [Sosia quoted the aphorism "Ne quid nimis" which translates to "Not anything in excess" or with some liberty to "Moderation in all things".]


play: The Self-Tormentor (163 BC)
=================================

:: Title
The Self-Tormentor

:: Date
163 BC

:: Description
Heauton Timorumenos (Ἑαυτὸν τιμωρούμενος, Greek for The Self-Tormentor) is a
play written in Latin by Terence (Latin: Publius Terentius Afer), a dramatist
of the Roman Republic, in 163 BC. The play has presented academics with some
problems. Firstly it is not entirely clear whether Heauton Timorumenos is
Terence's second or third play. More importantly, due to the scant survival of
Menander's play of the same name, there is no simple way to judge how much of
Terence's version is translation and how much is invention. It is set in a
village in the countryside of Attica.

:: Choice Themes

:: Major Themes
neighbor and neighbor [The wealthy farmer Menedemus was being advised by his next-door neighbors Cheremes on how to handle the sudden and unexpected return of his estranged son, Clinia. Stated in passing was that the neighbors Simus and Cirto were engaged in a boundary dispute.]
father and son [The play follow two father and son relationships: 1) The wealthy farmer Menedemus fretted over what to do when word reached him that his estranged son, Clinia, was back in town and in love with a spendthrift girl, and 2) Clitipho went to elaborate measures to conceal the identity of his lover from his father Cheremes.]
friendship [Clitipho went to elaborate lengths to help his pal Clinia secure Antiphilia's hand in marriage.]
infatuation [Clinia and Antiphilia were in the throws of love, and in the end they married.]
beating one's self up [Menedemus was anguishing over having driven his son, Clinia, away by being too stern in the past. This is central to the story on account that Menedemus' actions following his son's sudden and unexpected return were dictated by his guilt over what he'd done.]
fatherly disappointment in a son [Menedemus tells Chremes about how Menedemus fell out with his own son over the son's choice of a love interest. This conflict is at the core of the entire story. Also Chremes nearly falls out with his own son for the same reasons.]
getting a taste of one's own medicine [Chremes had lectured Menedemus about Menedemus' son's romantic indiscretions; then at the end of the story Chremes' son is revealed to be in love with an expensive prostitute, leaving Chremes in the same pickle Menedemus had been in, and the latter gets to reproach the former.] {MO: perhaps minor. PS: I suppose minor is reasonable.}
hypocritical character [One grand revelation at the conclusion of the story is that Chremes was hypocritical and about to treat his own son in the way Chremes had chastised Menedemus for treating Menedemus' son.]
remorse [Menedemus is (eponymously) tormenting himself for having alienated his son.]
reconciliation [The story concludes with the fathers and sons reconciling.]
con artistry [At the heart of the story lies the slave Syrus and the courtesan Bacchis' intricate schemes to extract money from Chremes and Menedemus.]
master and slave [Clitipho relied on his slave Syrus to conceive of and execute an elaborate ruse. Clinia and his slave Dromo.]

:: Minor Themes
disapproving parent [Menedemus had come to regret having once chastised his son, Clinia, for having gotten involved with an impoverished girl.]
female stereotype ["You know what women are", quipped Clitipho, "plans and preparations can take them a year".]
gastronomy [Bacchis' was tasting and spitting out various wines at Cheremes' dinner party.] {PS: We might rethink this theme a bit. It's a "regular activity" so doesn't really apply here. But there's wine tasting going on all the same, and many of the "gastronomy" usages pertain to wine tasting.}
miserliness [Menedemus was a "mean old miser of a father" to Clinia said Syrus.]
husband and wife [Sostrata revealed to her husband, Cheremes, that she'd disobeyed him years prior by failing to do away with their newborn girl as she'd been told.]
infanticide [Cheremes had years prior ordered a pregnant Sostrata not to rear the child, if it turned out to be a girl.]
mother and son [Clitipho confronted his mother, Sostrata, and pleaded with her to reveal if he was really her son.]
unknown parent [Racked with doubt, Clitipho begged Sostrata to tell him who his real parents were.]
brother and sister [In a surprise twist, Clitipho and Antiphila turned out to be so.]
creative writing [Terence writes about writing plays as he retaliates against his detractors in the introduction.] {PS: I'm worried about including these prologue theme. They are not part of the play proper. If we must include them, how about making this as a frame story and putting the prologue as a separate entry?}
gold digging [Bacchis was unblushingly a gold digger, and perhaps a prostitute to boot.]
arranged marriage [Sostrata promised to find a good bride for her son.]
