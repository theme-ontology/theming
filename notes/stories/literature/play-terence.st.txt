friendship [Charinus was dismayed by the rumors that his dear friend Pamphilus was in love with the very girl whom Charinus fancied. Simo and his old friend Chremes came into conflict what should have been a routine arranged marriage between Simo's son and Chremes' daughter.]

:: Minor Themes
love vs. friendship [Pamphilus nearly fell out with Charinus because of romantic complications.]

play: The Self-Tormentor (163 BC)
=================================

:: Title
The Self-Tormentor

:: Date
163 BC

:: Description
Heauton Timorumenos (Ἑαυτὸν τιμωρούμενος, Greek for The Self-Tormentor) is a
play written in Latin by Terence (Latin: Publius Terentius Afer), a dramatist
of the Roman Republic, in 163 BC. The play has presented academics with some
problems. Firstly it is not entirely clear whether Heauton Timorumenos is
Terence's second or third play. More importantly, due to the scant survival of
Menander's play of the same name, there is no simple way to judge how much of
Terence's version is translation and how much is invention. It is set in a
village in the countryside of Attica.

play: Phormio (161 BC)
======================

:: Title
Phormio

:: Date
161 BC

:: Description
Phormio is a Latin comic play by the early Roman playwright Terence, based on
a now lost play by Apollodorus of Carystus entitled Epidikazomenos ("The
Claimant"). It is generally believed to be Terence's fourth play. It was first
performed at the Ludi Romani of 161 BC. Structurally, Phormio is considered to
be one of the best Roman comedies.

The plot is set in Athens, and revolves around the love affairs of two young
men, Phaedria and Antipho, who are cousins. Phaedria is in love with a
harp-player called Pamphila, but doesn't have the money to buy her from her
owner Dorio; Antipho wishes to marry a free but poor girl called Phanium,
unaware that she is in fact Phaedria's half sister as the result of an affair
between Phaedria's father Chremes and a Lemnian woman. By clever legal
wrangling, Phormio manages to help both young men to obtain their wishes, and
in addition extracts a large sum of money from the two fathers.

infatuation [The plot revolves around the love affairs of two young men, Phaedria and Antipho.]
con artistry [Through his plotting and scheming, the titular character Phormio managed to secure for himself a large sum of money from two fathers in the process of helping their sons obtain the women they coveted.]

Much of the plot surrounded Phaedria trying to rustle up enough money to buy his love interest Pamphila from her owner Dorio.]
brother and brother [The brothers Demipho and Chremes were busy meddling in their sons love lives.] {PS: Note in the way of brainstorming: It's probably more interesting to focus on "X and Y conflict" moving forward (e.g. X=Y=brother; X=husband,Y=wife). "brother and brother" here in this story is featured, but in a potted plant-like way}

:: Minor Themes
