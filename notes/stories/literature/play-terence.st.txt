Terence's plays to be performed post-antiquity, in Florence in 1476. It was
adapted by Machiavelli, whose Andria was likewise the author's first venture
into playwriting, and was the first of Terence's plays to be translated into
English ca. 1520. The second English translation was by the Welsh writer
Morris Kyffin in 1588.

:: Choice Themes
father and son [The story concerned conflict between Simo and his son Pamphilus regarding whom the latter should marry.]

:: Major Themes
fatherly disappointment in a son [Simo was upset at his son Pamphilus' behavior regarding Glycerium, and later for perceived lying and scheming.]
infatuation [Pamphilus and Glycerium were besotted with each other.]
master and slave [The story much concerned the scheming or perceived scheming of slaves, especially Davus, to manipulate their masters. Simo and his slave Sosia (latterly a freedman). Charinus and his slave Byrrhia. Pamphilus and his slave Davus.]
choosing between love and family [Pamphilus was torn between his love for Glycerium and his duty to his father.]
arranged marriage [Central to the story was that Simo had arranged a marriage for Pamhpilus that Pamphilus didn't care for. Chremes arranged two marriages for his daughters (Glycerium being deemed his in the end).]
friendship [Charinus was dismayed by the rumors that his dear friend Pamphilus was in love with the very girl whom Charinus fancied. Simo and his old friend Chremes came into conflict what should have been a routine arranged marriage between Simo's son and Chremes' daughter.]

:: Minor Themes
love vs. friendship [Pamphilus nearly fell out with Charinus because of romantic complications.]
father and daughter [Chremes and his daughter Philumena.]
male promiscuousness [Mysis complained to Lesbia about how men never stay faithful.]
lovers' quarrel [Charinus said "lovers' quarrels are renewal of love".]
keeping secrets [Mysis agree to keep secret Pamphilus' impending wedding ceremony from his lover Glycerium on account that news of the event might too much for the pregnant Glycerium to take.]
miserliness [Davus apparently reluctantly told Simo that Simo had a reputation for being tight with his money.]
mimetic desire [Charinus said "It was only after I told you I loved her that you took a fancy to her" to Pamphilus in regard to Charinus' love interest Philumena.]
class prejudice in society [Simo disapproved over his son, Pamphilus, dallying with a woman of such apparent low birth as Glycerium, who it seemed was the sister of a harlot.]
moderation in all things [Sosia quoted the aphorism "Ne quid nimis" which translates to "Not anything in excess" or with some liberty to "Moderation in all things".]


play: The Self-Tormentor (163 BC)
=================================

:: Title
The Self-Tormentor

:: Date
163 BC

:: Description
Heauton Timorumenos (Ἑαυτὸν τιμωρούμενος, Greek for The Self-Tormentor) is a
play written in Latin by Terence (Latin: Publius Terentius Afer), a dramatist
of the Roman Republic, in 163 BC. The play has presented academics with some
problems. Firstly it is not entirely clear whether Heauton Timorumenos is
Terence's second or third play. More importantly, due to the scant survival of
Menander's play of the same name, there is no simple way to judge how much of
Terence's version is translation and how much is invention. It is set in a
village in the countryside of Attica.

beating one's self up [Menedemus was anguishing over having driven his son, Clinia, away by being too stern in the past. This is central to the story on account that Menedemus' actions following his son's sudden and unexpected return were dictated by his guilt over what he'd done.]

:: Minor Themes
female stereotype ["You know what women are", quipped Clitipho, "plans and preparations can take them a year".]
miserliness [Menedemus was a "mean old miser of a father" to Clinia said Syrus.]
husband and wife [Sostrata revealed to her husband, Chremes, that she'd disobeyed him years prior by failing to do away with their newborn girl as she'd been told.]
infanticide [Chremes had years prior ordered a pregnant Sostrata not to rear the child, if it turned out to be a girl.]
mother and son [Clitipho confronted his mother, Sostrata, and pleaded with her to reveal if he was really her son.]
unknown parent [Racked with doubt, Clitipho begged Sostrata to tell him who his real parents were.]
brother and sister [In a surprise twist, Clitipho and Antiphila turned out to be so.]
creative writing [Terence writes about writing plays as he retaliates against his detractors in the introduction.]
gold digging [The courtesan Bacchis was unblushingly a gold digger.]
arranged marriage [Sostrata promised to find a good bride for her son.]
getting a taste of one's own medicine [Chremes had lectured Menedemus about Menedemus' son's romantic indiscretions; then at the end of the story Chremes' son is revealed to be in love with an expensive prostitute, leaving Chremes in the same pickle Menedemus had been in, and the latter gets to reproach the former.]
hypocritical character [At the conclusion of the story is that Chremes was hypocritical and about to treat his own son in the way Chremes had chastised Menedemus for treating Menedemus' son.]
