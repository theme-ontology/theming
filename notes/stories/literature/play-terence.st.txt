play: The Self-Tormentor (163 BC)
=================================

:: Title
The Self-Tormentor

:: Date
163 BC

:: Description
Heauton Timorumenos (Ἑαυτὸν τιμωρούμενος, Greek for The Self-Tormentor) is a
play written in Latin by Terence (Latin: Publius Terentius Afer), a dramatist
of the Roman Republic, in 163 BC. The play has presented academics with some
problems. Firstly it is not entirely clear whether Heauton Timorumenos is
Terence's second or third play. More importantly, due to the scant survival of
Menander's play of the same name, there is no simple way to judge how much of
Terence's version is translation and how much is invention. It is set in a
village in the countryside of Attica.

play: Phormio (161 BC)
======================

:: Title
Phormio

:: Date
161 BC

:: Description
Phormio is a Latin comic play by the early Roman playwright Terence, based on
a now lost play by Apollodorus of Carystus entitled Epidikazomenos ("The
Claimant"). It is generally believed to be Terence's fourth play. It was first
performed at the Ludi Romani of 161 BC. Structurally, Phormio is considered to
be one of the best Roman comedies.

The plot is set in Athens, and revolves around the love affairs of two young
men, Phaedria and Antipho, who are cousins. Phaedria is in love with a
harp-player called Pamphila, but doesn't have the money to buy her from her
owner Dorio; Antipho wishes to marry a free but poor girl called Phanium,
unaware that she is in fact Phaedria's half sister as the result of an affair
between Phaedria's father Chremes and a Lemnian woman. By clever legal
wrangling, Phormio manages to help both young men to obtain their wishes, and
in addition extracts a large sum of money from the two fathers.
