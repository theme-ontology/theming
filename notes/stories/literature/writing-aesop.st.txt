Collection: Aesops Fables
=========================

:: Title
Aesop's Fables

:: Date
564 BC

:: Description
Aesop's Fables, or the Aesopica, is a collection of fables credited to Aesop,
a slave and storyteller believed to have lived in ancient Greece between 620
and 564 BCE. Of diverse origins, the stories associated with his name have
descended to modern times through a number of sources and continue to be
reinterpreted in different verbal registers and in popular as well as artistic
media.

The fables originally belonged to the oral tradition and were not collected
for some three centuries after Aesop's death. By that time a variety of other
stories, jokes and proverbs were being ascribed to him, although some of that
material was from sources earlier than him or came from beyond the Greek
cultural sphere. The process of inclusion has continued until the present,
with some of the fables unrecorded before the Late Middle Ages and others
arriving from outside Europe. The process is continuous and new stories are
still being added to the Aesop corpus, even when they are demonstrably more
recent work and sometimes from known authors.

:: Description
The Eagle and the Fox is a fable of friendship betrayed and revenged. Counted
as one of Aesop’s Fables, it is numbered 1 in the Perry Index. The central
situation concerns an eagle that seizes a fox’s cubs and bears them off to
feed its young. There are then alternative endings to the story, in one of
which the fox exacts restitution while in the other it gains retribution for
its injury.

The Eagle and the Beetle

:: Date
564 BC

:: Description
The story of the feud between the eagle and the beetle is one of Aesop's
Fables and often referred to in Classical times. It is numbered 3 in the Perry
Index and the episode became proverbial. Although different in detail, it can
be compared to the fable of The Eagle and the Fox. In both cases the eagle
believes itself safe from retribution for an act of violence and is punished
by the destruction of its young.

the desire for vengeance [The Beetle sought to avenge itself on the eagle.]

:: Minor Themes
