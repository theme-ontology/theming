:: Choice Themes
be wary of strangers [Charles Perrault sums up the moral of the story as follows: "From this story one learns that children, especially young lasses, pretty, courteous and well-bred, do very wrong to listen to strangers, And it is not an unheard thing if the Wolf is thereby provided with his dinner".]

:: Major Themes
human childhood [Little Red Riding-hood innocently trusted, and engaged in childish diversions such as chasing butterflies.]
wicked character vs. virtuous character [The conniving, deceitful Wolf was juxtaposed with the innocent little country girl Little Red Riding-hood.]
appearances can be deceiving [This common aphorism is illustrated by the Wolf dressing up in Little Red Riding-hood's grandmother's clothing in order to lull the poor child into a false sense of security.]

:: Minor Themes
mother and daughter [Little Red Riding-hood happily went on an errand at her dotting mother's bidding. The mother was concerned for her own mother in turn, the grandmother.]
grandmother and granddaughter [A little girl, whom everybody called Little Red Riding-hood, set out to deliver a custard and some butter to her very ill grandmother.]
coping with a loved one being gravely ill [The mother was concerned because the grandmother had recently been "very ill".]
