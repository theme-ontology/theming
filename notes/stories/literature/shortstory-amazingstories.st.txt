:: Description
Amazing Stories is an American science fiction magazine launched in April 1926
by Hugo Gernsback's Experimenter Publishing. It was the first magazine devoted
solely to science fiction. Science fiction stories had made regular
appearances in other magazines, including some published by Gernsback, but
Amazing helped define and launch a new genre of pulp fiction.
