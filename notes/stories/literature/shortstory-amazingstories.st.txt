the desire for vengeance [Much was made of Gnostes wanting to avenge his love interest Thora's killing at the hands of  Prah.]
extraterrestrial being [A novelty of the story concerns Gnostes visiting the men of Allos aliens on their "Blue World" home planet.]

:: Minor Themes
ransom kidnapping [The young scholar Gnostes was kidnapped by pirates, but "rescued" by the master of a trireme before they could collect the ransom.]
master and slave [The young scholar Gnostes was forced to toil as a slave oarsman aboard a trireme.]
human vs. captivity [The young scholar become slave Gnostes made his escape from the trireme at the first opportunity.]
facing organized pursuit [After making his initial escape, Gnostes was pursued by the trireme crewmen and their dogs all the way from the seashore to the Acropolis.]
antiscience in society [Gnostes spoke of how a new religion cropped up and suppressed any scientific knowledge at odds with its creed, resulting in a millennium long dark age.]
death ray [Gnostes described how Thora and Prah "seemed to shrivel up and disappear" when a death ray was turned on them.]
speculative spaceship [Gnostes described how to was ferried away to a distant planet, called the "Blue World", in an anti-gravity propelled, alien spacecraft.]
interstellar space travel [Gnostes described traveling to another star system, perhaps the Sirius system, in an alien spacecraft at relativistic speeds.]
anti-gravity technology [Gnostes was astonished to discover that his alien hosts had mastered this technology, which they used to propel their spacecraft and also create an environment aboard their vessel with the same gravity as Earth.]
insectoid being [The Blue World aliens were described by Gonestes as being something similar to the fly, yet shimmering with rainbow-like colors and in general quite dazzling to the eye.]
domed city [Gnostes observed the cities of the Blue World to be covered with heavy glass domes.]
telepathic ability [The Allos aliens communicated telepathically. In particular, Gnostes tutor Hekanos taught Gnostes to converse mind to mind.]
speculative full body outfit [Gnostes at times wore a special suit which counteracted the comparatively high gravity on the Blue World.]
suspended animation [Gnostes recounted being returned to Earth after a thousand or so year sleep in the Hall of Suspended Animation.]
coping with the death of a lover [Dr. Smead pined over a woman he'd loved, hinting that it was the ancient priestess Thora.]
the ethics of interfering in less advanced societies [In a precursor to the "Prime Directive" of Star Trek, the alien Hekanos explained that his race would share their advanced knowledge with humanity only when they are ready for it.]
