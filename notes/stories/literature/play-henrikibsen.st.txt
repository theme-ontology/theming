:: Choice Themes
father and daughter [Hjalmar and Hedvig]
familial love [Hedvig loved her father deeply and he doted on her until he discovered she might have been illegitimate]
having a skeleton in the closet [the Ekdal home is full of lies that people tell in order to get along. Gregers' father may have impregnated his servant Gina then married her off to Hjalmar to legitimize the child, and Hjalmar's father has been disgraced and imprisoned for a crime the elder Werle committed.]

:: Major Themes
coping with a disability [Hedvig was slowly going blind]
parenting a physically disabled child [Hedvig was slowly going blind]
neglectful parent [Hjalmar was somewhat negligent in his duties as a dad]
husband and wife [Gina and Hjalmar]
extramarital affair [Hjalmar learns that Gina has had an extramarital affair and that Hedvig might not be his biological daughter.]
realist vs. idealist [Greger was an idealist who believed truth must be told; other characters, for example Greger's father, were more down to earth]
to tell the truth vs. offering a comforting lie [we understand that the ideologue Greger was instrumental in upsetting the order in the Ekdal home, by uncovering various lies that the inhabitants lived by.]

:: Minor Themes
escape from reality [both Hedvig and Hjalmar engaged in ample day-dreaming: she on the attic, he about becoming an inventor]
