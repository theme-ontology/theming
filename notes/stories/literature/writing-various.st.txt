:: Description
Inferno (Italian: [iɱˈfɛrno]; Italian for "Hell") is the first part of Italian
writer Dante Alighieri's 14th-century epic poem Divine Comedy. It is followed
by Purgatorio and Paradiso. The Inferno describes Dante's journey through
Hell, guided by the ancient Roman poet Virgil. In the poem, Hell is depicted
as nine concentric circles of torment located within the Earth; it is the
"realm ... of those who have rejected spiritual values by yielding to bestial
appetites or violence, or by perverting their human intellect to fraud or
malice against their fellowmen".

As an allegory, the Divine Comedy represents the journey of the soul toward
God, with the Inferno describing the recognition and rejection of sin.
