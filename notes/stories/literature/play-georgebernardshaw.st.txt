play: Arms and the Man (1894)
=============================

:: Title
Arms and the Man

:: Date
1894-04-21

:: Description
The play takes place during the 1885 Serbo-Bulgarian War. Its heroine, Raina
Petkoff, is a young Bulgarian woman engaged to Sergius Saranoff, one of the
heroes of that war, whom she idolizes. On the night after the Battle of
Slivnitza, a Swiss mercenary soldier in the Serbian army, Captain Bluntschli,
climbs in through her bedroom balcony window and threatens to shoot Raina if
she gives the alarm. When Russian and Bulgarian troops burst in to search the
house for him, Raina hides him so that he won't be killed. He asks her to
remember that "nine soldiers out of ten are born fools." In a conversation
after the soldiers have left, Bluntschli's pragmatic and cynical attitude
towards war and soldiering shocks the idealistic Raina, especially after he
admits that he uses his ammunition pouches to carry chocolates rather than
cartridges for his pistol. When the search dies down, Raina and her mother
Catherine sneak Bluntschli out of the house, disguised in one of Raina's
father's old coats.

:: Date

Major Barbara is a three-act English play by George Bernard Shaw, written and
premiered in 1905 and first published in 1907. The story concerns an
idealistic young woman, Barbara Undershaft, who is engaged in helping the poor
as a Major in the Salvation Army in London. For many years, Barbara and her
siblings have been estranged from their father, Andrew Undershaft, who now
reappears as a rich and successful munitions maker. Undershaft, the father,
gives money to the Salvation Army, which offends Major Barbara, who does not
want to be connected to his "tainted" wealth. However, the father argues that
poverty is a worse problem than munitions, and claims that he is doing more to
help society by giving his workers jobs and a steady income than Major Barbara
is doing to help them by giving them bread and soup.

play: Man and Superman (1905)
=============================

:: Title
Man and Superman

:: Date
1905-05-23

:: Description
Man and Superman is a four-act drama written by George Bernard Shaw in 1903.
The series was written in response to a call for Shaw to write a play based on
the Don Juan theme. Mr. Whitefield has recently died, and his will indicates
that his daughter Ann should be left in the care of two men, Roebuck Ramsden
and John Tanner. Ramsden, a venerable old man, distrusts John Tanner, an
eloquent youth with revolutionary ideas, whom Shaw's stage directions describe
as "prodigiously fluent of speech, restless, excitable (mark the snorting
nostril and the restless blue eye, just the thirty-secondth of an inch too
wide open), possibly a little mad". In spite of what Ramsden says, Ann accepts
Tanner as her guardian, though Tanner doesn't want the position at all. She
also challenges Tanner's revolutionary beliefs with her own ideas. Despite
Tanner's professed dedication to anarchy, he is unable to disarm Ann's charm,
and she ultimately persuades him to marry her, choosing him over her more
persistent suitor, a young man, Tanner's friend, named Octavius Robinson.

play: Misalliance (1910)
========================

:: Title
Misalliance

:: Date
1910-02-23

:: Description
Misalliance is a play written in 1909–1910 by George Bernard Shaw. The play
takes place entirely on a single Saturday afternoon in the conservatory of a
large country house in Hindhead, Surrey in Edwardian era England.

It is a continuation of some of the ideas on marriage that he expressed in
1908 in his play, Getting Married. It was also a continuation of some of his
other ideas on Socialism, physical fitness, the Life Force, and "The New
Woman": i.e. women intent on escaping Victorian standards of helplessness,
passivity, stuffy propriety, and non-involvement in politics or general
affairs.

Misalliance is an ironic examination of the mating instincts of a varied group
of people gathered at a wealthy man's country home on a summer weekend. Most
of the romantic interest centers on the host's daughter, Hypatia Tarleton, a
typical Shaw heroine who exemplifies his lifelong theory that in courtship,
women are the relentless pursuers and men the apprehensively pursued.

failure but by economic necessity. Elements of the play were borrowed from

due to limited employment opportunities.

The Doctor's Dilemma is a play by George Bernard Shaw first staged in 1906. It

business and a vocation.

The eponymous dilemma of the play is that of the newly honoured doctor Sir
Colenso Ridgeon, who has developed a revolutionary new cure for tuberculosis.
However, his private medical practice, with limited staff and resources, can
only treat ten patients at a time. From a group of fifty patients he has
selected ten he believes he can cure and who, he believes, are most worthy of
being saved. However, when he is approached by a young woman, Jennifer
Dubedat, with a deadly ill husband, Louis Dubedat, he admits he can, at a
stretch, save one more patient, but that the individual in question must be
shown to be most worthy of being saved.
