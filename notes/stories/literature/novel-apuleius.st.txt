:: Description
The Metamorphoses of Apuleius, which Augustine of Hippo referred to as The
Golden Ass (Asinus aureus), is the only ancient Roman novel in Latin to
survive in its entirety.

The protagonist of the novel is called Lucius. At the end of the novel, he is
revealed to be from Madaurus, the hometown of Apuleius himself. The plot
revolves around the protagonist's curiosity and insatiable desire to see and
practice magic. While trying to perform a spell to transform into a bird, he
is accidentally transformed into an ass. This leads to a long journey, literal
and metaphorical, filled with inset tales. He finally finds salvation through
the intervention of the goddess Isis, whose cult he joins.
