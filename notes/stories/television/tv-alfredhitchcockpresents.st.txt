to the embassy, where her story is believed only by Basil Farnham. Diana and
Basil demand to see the room, which is very different from Diana's

The Contest for Aaron Gold

:: Date
1960-10-18

:: Description
Bernie is a ceramics teacher at a summer camp, and is protective of Aaron
Gold, a boy who dislikes athletics but loves sculpture. As Aaron has no other
accomplishments, the camp's performance-driven owner Stern orders that Bernie
"finish" Aaron's sculpture of a one-armed knight to show off to Aaron's
father. Bernie adds the arm, which upsets Aaron deeply, because the statue is
a tribute to Aaron's father, who only has one arm.

dealing with children [Bernie struggled to teach his camp class of unruly brats. They nagged him about why they had to call him "uncle", for example.

human occupational activity [In his sketch, Alfred Hitchcock was doing pottery.]
boss and employee [The camp instructor Bernie succumbed to pressure from the performance-driven owner Stern to complete young Aaron's clay sculpture of a one-armed knight.]
father and son [The grand revelation of the story is that the sculpture of a one-armed knight that young Aaron had been working on all summer was a depiction of his father, whom the boy evidently admired very much.]
filial love [Young Aaron so admired his one-armed father that he spent all his time at summer camp making a sculpture of him as a one-armed knight.]

The Sorcerer's Apprentice

:: Date
1962

:: Description
Hugo is a dim-witted boy without a home. He is taken in by a kind carnival
magician Sadini. Sadini's deceitful wife, Irene, performs in her husband's act
as the woman whose body is, supposedly, sawed in half. Irene manipulates Hugo
into killing her husband. She says she wants to start a new act with Hugo and
convinces him that he can perform the sawing the woman in half trick because
the magic is in the wand. Hugo killers Sadini for her, but then she backs out
on her promise. Hugo knocks out Irene in a struggle. He then decides to
attempt the trick and ends up sawing Irene in half for real.

:: Choice Themes
stage magic [Central to the story is the idea that the dim-witted boy, Hugo, was hoodwinked into thinking that the magic act of Sadini was real.]
stereotypically innocent character [The dim-witted boy Hugo was naïvely unprepared for daily life at the carnival. He misjudged the deceitful Irene because she was beautiful, and likewise the kind-hearted carnival magician Sadini because his goatee made him look like the devil. He didn't understand that stage magic wasn't real, and was delusional about his prospects of Irene becoming his lover.]

:: Major Themes
murder [Although perhaps not entirely understanding what he was doing, Hugo killed both Sadini and Irene.]
spouse murder [Irene was unarguably culpable in Sadini's death, seeing as she had manipulated Hugo into doing the deed.]
mental retardation [Hugo was a mentally retarded boy who had escaped from the (unspecified) institution in which he had been living.]
helping a stranger in need [Upon finding Hugo passed out in front of a hot dog stand, the carnival magician Sadini took him in to his trailer and took care of the boy without asking for anything in return. Sadini was notably kind in taking in Hugo, and this was remarked upon more than once.]
poetic justice [Irene sought to trick Hugo into killing Sadini by convincing Hugo that the magic was real. Thus convinced, ironically, Hugo proceeded to saw Irene in half.]
husband and wife [The story turns on Irene using the dim-witted boy, Hugo, to rid herself of her carnival magician husband, Sadini.]
extramarital affair [Irene had an affair with George behind Sadini's back, and plotted to get rid of her husband so that they could steal his act.]
infatuation [The dim-witted boy Hugo became infatuated with the beautiful Irene, not understanding that she was way out of his league.]
superstitiousness [The dim-witted boy Hugo was pointedly superstitious in his thinking that Sadini was the devil and that stage magic was real.]

:: Minor Themes
vivisection [In his sketch, Alfred Hitchcock had to settle for making divinations based on goat X-rays because of anti-vivisectionist efforts to prevent him from doing it by eviscerating goats like the Romans of old.]
divination [In his sketch, Alfred Hitchcock spoke of how the Romans divined the future by examining animal entrails, before using the comparatively tidy expedient of goat X-rays to make some of his own divinations.]
coping with starvation [Hugo had been so hungry that he fainted outside the hotdog stand at the carnival.]
love triangle [Irene was romantically involved with George behind her husband, Sadini, back.]
substance intoxication [George passed out drunk in the middle of warning Hugo that Irene was plotting against Hugo.]
