Star Trek: Discovery is an American television series created for CBS All
Access by Bryan Fuller and Alex Kurtzman. It is the first series developed
specifically for that service, and the first Star Trek series since Star Trek:
Enterprise concluded in 2005. Set roughly a decade before the events of the
original Star Trek series and separate from the timeline of the concurrently
produced feature films, Discovery explores the Federation–Klingon war while
following the crew of the USS Discovery. Gretchen J. Berg and Aaron Harberts
served as showrunners for the first season, with producing support from Akiva
Goldsman; Kurtzman began serving as showrunner during the second season.
