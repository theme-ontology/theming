==================================

:: Title
The Twilight Zone

:: Date
1959-1964

:: Description
The Twilight Zone is an American anthology television series created and
presented by Rod Serling, which ran for five seasons on CBS from 1959 to 1964.
Each episode presents a stand-alone story in which characters find themselves
dealing with often disturbing or unusual events, an experience described as
entering "the Twilight Zone," often with a surprise ending and a moral.
Although predominantly science-fiction, the show's paranormal and Kafkaesque
events leaned the show towards fantasy and horror. The phrase “twilight zone,”
inspired by the series, is used to describe surreal experiences.

:: Choice Themes
war crime [Becker mentioned the Nuremberg trials, thus making it clear in what light the rest of the encounter should be viewed; Lutze was tried for crimes against humanity, in the Twilight Zone.]
The Holocaust [We saw a former Nazi revisit the Dachau concentration camp, where he encountered ghosts of his many victims.]

:: Major Themes
sadism [Captain Lutze recalled his many cruel concentration time actions and interactions with glee. Becker called him a sadist.]
punishment in the afterlife [Lutze was made to undergo the same horrors he had imposed on the inmates in the Twilight Zone.]
the desire for vengeance [The ghosts of the concentration camp inmates quite understandably wanted vengeance, and the so-called trial was not conducted by an uninterested party meaning it can hardly be called lawful justice (cf. the desire for justice) though there is a case for the theme.]

:: Minor Themes
poetic justice [The concentration camp commandant Lutze was made to undergo the same horrors he had imposed on his former inmates. It is a case of poetic justice since the punishment was mediated by his former prisoner Becker.]
patriotism [Lutze invoked patriotism to explain why he had returned to the Fatherland.]
World War II [Lutze falsely claimed that he had served in Russian front in a Panzer devision during the war.]
duty to disobey illegal orders [Captain Lutze insisted that he was only following orders when he tortured and ordered the executions of concentration prisoners.]
unethical human experimentation [Lutze was charged with having authorized the use of concentration camp inmates in medical experiments.]

ironic twist of fate [In donning the Professor's infernal helmet, Mulligan believed he would visit a place of peace and quiet, but through a cruel twist of fate he instead found himself in an even more pandemonious future.
