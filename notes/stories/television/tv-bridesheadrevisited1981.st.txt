:: Description
Brideshead Revisited is a 1981 British television serial starring Jeremy Irons
and Anthony Andrews. It was produced by Granada Television for broadcast by
the ITV network. Significant elements of it were directed by Michael
Lindsay-Hogg, who handled the initial phases of the production, before Charles
Sturridge carried on with the series. The first episode is credited to both
men equally.

The serial is an adaptation of the novel Brideshead Revisited (1945) by Evelyn
Waugh. It follows, from the 1920s to the early 1940s, the life and romances of
the protagonist Charles Ryderâ€”including his friendship with the Flytes, a
family of wealthy English Catholics who live in a palatial mansion called
Brideshead Castle. The screenplay was written by Derek Granger (the series'
producer) and others. Although the credits attribute the screenplay to John
Mortimer, Mortimer's script was not used. Charles Sturridge declared that 95%
of the dialogue was from Waugh's original text. The 11-episode serial
premiered on ITV in the UK on 12 October 1981; on CBC Television in Canada on
19 October 1981; and as part of the Great Performances series on PBS in the US
on 18 January 1982.

:: Title
Et in Arcadia Ego

:: Date
1981-10-12

:: Description
In the spring of 1943, disillusioned Army captain Charles Ryder is moving his
company to a new Brigade headquarters at a secret location - which he
discovers is Brideshead, once home to the Marchmain family and the scene of
both pleasant and anguished visits for the younger Charles.

Seeing the house for the first time in several years prompts a recollection of
Charles's first meeting with Lord Sebastian Flyte, the Marchmains' younger
son, at the University of Oxford in 1922, and the rest of the narrative moves
from that time forward. At Oxford, the two young men quickly bond and although
his cousin warns him to avoid Sebastian and his circle of friends, Charles is
fascinated by them, particularly the flamboyant and openly gay aesthete
Anthony Blanche. Short on funds, Charles finds himself fitfully spending the
summer holidays in London with his indifferent and rigid father Edward until
an urgent message from Sebastian takes him to Brideshead. There, Charles
briefly meets Sebastian's sister Julia, and is introduced to a world of wealth
and privilege dominated by a powerful devotion to Catholicism.

:: Choice Themes
life in late modern Britain [The story portrays life for a variety of people across the social strata, in Britain during the dusk of the interwar period as well as during the Second World War.]
friendship [A point of the story is to portray the inception and early development of an intimate friendship between Charles and Sebastian.]

:: Major Themes
what it is like in university [This episode is to a large extend centered on Charles' and Sebastian's days in the university of Oxford.]
youth rebellion [The story follows Charles as he enters the University of Oxford and is admonished by his older relatives. He decides to go against all their advice, fall in with a "disreputable" crowd, and eventually drops out.]
military related work [A part of the story is set during Charles' supposed "present" time where he serves as captain in the British armed army.]
the importance of reputation [Charles was guided by his older cousin at University, and admonished to care for his reputation. He gleefully let himself fall in with a "disreputable" clique. There were many remarks made about different peoples' reputation, including that of Sebastian, Charles, Anthony Blanche, and Charles' cousin.]
aristocracy vs. bourgeoisie [A point of the story is arguably to compare and contrast the wealthy and ennobled Marchmain family with various well-to-do middle class people in Britain during the interwar period.]

:: Minor Themes
World War II [While far removed from the fighting, the opening part of the story is set in England during the days of the Second World War.]
master and servant [Charles conversed with his manservant, Lunt, at Oxford several times.]
human occupational activity <barber> [Charles conversed with the old barber while receiving hair dressing services.]
male homosexuality [Comments were made about the reputation of Anthony Blanche, who was flamboyantly homosexual and had been subjected to such treatments as being dunked in a pond. Sebastian was probably homosexual (as seen in his interactions with Anthony Blanche) though nothing romantic was explicitly made clear about his relationship with Charles.] {PS: knock up?}
Catholicism [Sebastian was a devout Catholic and Charles was an outspoken Atheist. On one occasion Sebastian brought Charles to the family chapel, where Charles kneeled and crossed himself to Sebastian's consternation.]
alcohol abuse [Charles and Sebastian first met after Sebastian drank too much wine and barfed while leaning in through Charles' window. Other scenes of drunken antics followed, foreshadowing Sebastian's ultimate fate.]
mathematics [A group of young ambitious aspiring academics met in Charles' apartments to discuss books on logic.]
grandmother and grandson [Sebastian adored Nanny Hawkins and insisted Charles come and meet her.]
brother and sister [Sebastian expressed disdain for his all-too likeable older sister, Julia.]
love at first sight [Charles was pointedly dazed first by Sebastian and later by Julia, even upon laying eyes on each of them for the first time.]
mother and son [Sebastian expressed disdain for his mother.]
father and son [Sebastian mentioned his father with something like respect, by stark contrast with how he spoke of his mother. Charles went to live with his father to save money between semesters.]
rich character vs. poor character [] {PS: We don't really have a theme for when a wealth disparity between characters is featured. But I think that is at the heart of what was going on here.}
what if I was super rich [Through the eyes of Charles, a middle class boy, we were invited to imagine what it would be like to have the vast fortunes of the Marchmain family at our disposal. Although he played it cool, Charles was clearly dazzled by their opulence.] {MO: could be major}
rich character vs. poor character [Through the eyes of Charles, a middle class boy, we were invited to imagine what it would be like to have the vast fortunes of the Marchmain family at our disposal. Although he played it cool, Charles was clearly dazzled by their opulence. Charles later found himself penniless, though he had the good fortune (unrecognized by Charles) of being able to live with his father.] {MO: could be major}
human familial relationship [Charles heard sound advice from his older cousin and pointedly rejected it, at Oxford University.]
coping with aging [Charles lamented to himself that he, at the age of 39, was now old.]
coping with a loved one being in peril [Charles hastened to Brideshead Castle upon receiving a telegram from his bosom friend, Sebastian, requesting Charles' immediate presence on account that he'd been "gravely injured". Charles arrived to find that Sebastian had scarcely more than stubbed his toe, and that it was all just a ploy to bring Charles near to him.]

friendship [A point of the story is to portray the inception and early development of an intimate friendship between Charles and Sebastian.]
male homosexuality [The question of whether the relationship between Charles and Sebastian is homosexual or platonic is the subject of scholarly debate. In one viewing of the series, the intimacy of their interactions is suggestive of a romantic male friendship in an era defined by internalized homophobia.]

:: Major Themes
life in late modern Britain [The story portrays life for a variety of people across the social strata, in Britain during the dusk of the interwar period as well as during the Second World War.]
aristocracy vs. bourgeoisie [A point of the story is arguably to compare and contrast the wealthy and ennobled Marchmain family with various well-to-do middle class people in Britain during the interwar period.]
brother and sister [Sebastian and Julia were, their expressed disdain notwithstanding, obviously fond of each other.] {PS: minor? FYI: It was the other sister Cordelia in this episode.}
father and son [Sebastian mentioned his father with something like respect, by stark contrast with how he spoke of his mother. Charles went to live with his father to save money between semesters. A portion of the story concerned the psychological game Charles and his father were engaging in while Charles was at home. Sebastian met his father in Venice.]
Catholicism [Sebastian was a devout Catholic and Charles was an outspoken Atheist. There were several conversations that revolved around this faith. The Marchmain's were a minority in having it. They thought Charles was odd for being an Agnostic. They lamented that the bishop of London was going to close their family chapel, as it had too small a clientele.]
extramarital affair [It was an open secret that Lord Marchmain was living with his mistress in Venice. Charles expressed discomfort about living under the same roof as the adulterous pair, but later came to like them both.]
mother and son [Sebastian expressed disdain for his mother. Central to the episode was how Lord Marchmain hated his wife and lived openly with his mistress, Cara, in Venice. Cara explained how and why Lady Marchmain was hated.] {PS: minor?}
what it is like to travel [This installment of the series follows Charles and Sebastian as they vacation together in Venice.]

youth rebellion [The story follows Charles as he enters the University of Oxford and is admonished by his older relatives. He decides to go against all their advice, fall in with a "disreputable" crowd, and eventually drops out.] {PS: Not much going on on this front in this episode.}
master and servant [The Marchmains relied on their butler Jenkins to see to their personal needs.]
alcohol abuse [Charles and Sebastian got shitfaced together many times at Brideshead. Scenes of drunken antics followed, foreshadowing Sebastian's ultimate fate which was alluded to by the narrator.]
what if I was super rich [Through the eyes of Charles, an upper middle class youth, we were invited to imagine what it would be like to have the vast fortunes of the Marchmain family at our disposal. Although he played it cool, Charles was clearly dazzled by their opulence.] {MO: could be major. PS: Sure}

Charles later found himself penniless, though he had the good fortune (unrecognized by Charles) of being able to live with his father.] {MO: could be major. PS: I think we'd do well to coin a more general theme contrasting people by wealth disparity}
gastronomy [Charles and Sebastian read a book on wine appreciation and sampled numerous expensive bottles of the stuff from the Marchmain cellar.]
faith vs. reason [] {FD Charles and Sebastian briefly debated the logic of having faith. Sebastian said he had faith because the ideas were "lovely", which Charles rationally objected to as a silly reason to believe in something.}
atheism [The Marchmain's, devout Catholics, found Charles expressed atheism or agnosticism peculiar and exotic.]
love [Cara spoke about the Marchmain family and who loved and hated whom.]
