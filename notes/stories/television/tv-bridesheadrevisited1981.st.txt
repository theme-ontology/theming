:: Description
Brideshead Revisited is a 1981 British television serial starring Jeremy Irons and Anthony Andrews. It was produced by Granada Television for broadcast by the ITV network. Significant elements of it were directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who handled the initial phases of the production, before Charles Sturridge carried on with the series. The first episode is credited to both men equally.

The serial is an adaptation of the novel Brideshead Revisited (1945) by Evelyn Waugh. It follows, from the 1920s to the early 1940s, the life and romances of the protagonist Charles Ryderâ€”including his friendship with the Flytes, a family of wealthy English Catholics who live in a palatial mansion called Brideshead Castle. The screenplay was written by Derek Granger (the series' producer) and others. Although the credits attribute the screenplay to John Mortimer, Mortimer's script was not used. Charles Sturridge declared that 95% of the dialogue was from Waugh's original text. The 11-episode serial premiered on ITV in the UK on 12 October 1981; on CBC Television in Canada on 19 October 1981; and as part of the Great Performances series on PBS in the US on 18 January 1982.

Et in Arcadia Ego

:: Description
In the spring of 1943, disillusioned Army captain Charles Ryder is moving his company to a new Brigade headquarters at a secret location - which he discovers is Brideshead, once home to the Marchmain family and the scene of both pleasant and anguished visits for the younger Charles.

Seeing the house for the first time in several years prompts a recollection of Charles's first meeting with Lord Sebastian Flyte, the Marchmains' younger son, at the University of Oxford in 1922, and the rest of the narrative moves from that time forward. At Oxford, the two young men quickly bond and although his cousin warns him to avoid Sebastian and his circle of friends, Charles is fascinated by them, particularly the flamboyant and openly gay aesthete Anthony Blanche. Short on funds, Charles finds himself fitfully spending the summer holidays in London with his indifferent and rigid father Edward until an urgent message from Sebastian takes him to Brideshead. There, Charles briefly meets Sebastian's sister Julia, and is introduced to a world of wealth and privilege dominated by a powerful devotion to Catholicism.

:: Choice Themes
life in late modern Britain [The story portrays life for a variety of people across the social strata, in Britain during the dusk of the interwar period as well as during the Second World War.]
friendship [A point of the story is to portray the inception and early development of an intimate friendship between Charles and Sebastian.]

:: Major Themes
what it is like in university [This episode is to a large extend centered on Charles' and Sebastian's days in the university of Oxford.]
youth rebellion [The story follows Charles as he enters the University of Oxford and is admonished by his older relatives. He decides to go against all their advice, fall in with a "disreputable" crowd, and eventually drops out.]
military related work [A part of the story is set during Charles' supposed "present" time where he serves as Captain in the British armed army.]
the importance of reputation [Charles was guided by his older cousin at University, and admonished to care for his reputation. He gleefully let himself fall in with a "disreputable" clique. There were many remarks made about different peoples' reputation, including that of Sebastian, Charles, Anthony Blanche, and Charles' cousin.]
aristocracy vs. bourgeoisie [A point of the story is arguably to compare and contrast the wealthy and ennobled Marchmain family with various well-to-do middle class people in Britain during the interwar period.]

:: Minor Themes
World War II [While far removed from the fighting, a part of the story is set during the days of the Second World War.]
master and servant [Charles conversed with his manservant at Oxford several times.]
human occupational activity <barber> [Charles conversed with the old barber while receiving hair dressing services.]
male homosexuality [Comments were made about the reputation of Anthony Blanche, who was flamboyantly homosexual and had been subjected to such treatments as being dunked in a pond. Sebastian was probably homosexual (as seen in his interactions with Anthony Blanche) though nothing romantic was explicitly made clear about his relationship with Charles.]
Catholicism [Sebastian was a devout Catholic and Charles was an outspoken Atheist. On one occasion Sebastian brought Charles to the family chapel, where Charles kneeled and crossed himself to Sebastian's consternation.]
alcohol abuse [Charles and Sebastian first met after Sebastian drank too much wine and barfed while leaning in through Charles' window. Other scenes of drunken antics followed, foreshadowing Sebastian's ultimate fate.]
mathematics [A group of young ambitious aspiring academics met in Charles' apartments to discuss books on logic.]
grandmother and grandson [Sebastian adored "Nanny" ?? and insisted Charles come and meet her.]
brother and sister [Sebastian expressed disdain for his all-too likeable older sister, Julia.]
love at first sight [Charles was pointedly dazed first by Sebastian and later by Julia, even upon laying eyes on each of them for the first time.]
mother and son [Sebastian expressed disdain for his mother.]
father and son [Sebastian mentioned his father with something like respect, by stark contrast with how he spoke of his mother. Charles went to live with his father to save money between semesters.]
rich character vs. poor character []
what if I was super rich [Through the eyes of Charles, a middle class boy, we were invited to imagine what it would be like to have the vast fortunes of the Marchmain family at our disposal. Although he played it cool, Charles was clearly dazzled by their opulence.] {MO: could be major}

human familial relationship [Charles heard sound advice from his older cousin and pointedly rejected it, at Oxford University.]
