:: Description
Brideshead Revisited is a 1981 British television serial starring Jeremy Irons
and Anthony Andrews. It was produced by Granada Television for broadcast by
the ITV network. Significant elements of it were directed by Michael
Lindsay-Hogg, who handled the initial phases of the production, before Charles
Sturridge carried on with the series. The first episode is credited to both
men equally.

The serial is an adaptation of the novel Brideshead Revisited (1945) by Evelyn
Waugh. It follows, from the 1920s to the early 1940s, the life and romances of
the protagonist Charles Ryder—including his friendship with the Flytes, a
family of wealthy English Catholics who live in a palatial mansion called
Brideshead Castle. The screenplay was written by Derek Granger (the series'
producer) and others. Although the credits attribute the screenplay to John
Mortimer, Mortimer's script was not used. Charles Sturridge declared that 95%
of the dialogue was from Waugh's original text. The 11-episode serial
premiered on ITV in the UK on 12 October 1981; on CBC Television in Canada on
19 October 1981; and as part of the Great Performances series on PBS in the US
on 18 January 1982.

Et in Arcadia Ego

:: Date
1981-10-12

:: Description
In the spring of 1943, disillusioned Army captain Charles Ryder is moving his
company to a new Brigade headquarters at a secret location - which he
discovers is Brideshead, once home to the Marchmain family and the scene of
both pleasant and anguished visits for the younger Charles.

Seeing the house for the first time in several years prompts a recollection of
Charles's first meeting with Lord Sebastian Flyte, the Marchmains' younger
son, at the University of Oxford in 1922, and the rest of the narrative moves
from that time forward. At Oxford, the two young men quickly bond and although
his cousin warns him to avoid Sebastian and his circle of friends, Charles is
fascinated by them, particularly the flamboyant and openly gay aesthete
Anthony Blanche. Short on funds, Charles finds himself fitfully spending the
summer holidays in London with his indifferent and rigid father Edward until
an urgent message from Sebastian takes him to Brideshead. There, Charles
briefly meets Sebastian's sister Julia, and is introduced to a world of wealth
and privilege dominated by a powerful devotion to Catholicism.

friendship [A point of the story is to portray the inception and early development of an intimate friendship between Charles and Sebastian.]

:: Major Themes
life in late modern Britain [The story portrays life for a variety of people across the social strata, in Britain during the interwar period as well as during the Second World War.]
what it is like in university [This episode is to a large extend centered on Charles' and Sebastian's days in the University of Oxford.]
youth rebellion [The story follows Charles as he enters the University of Oxford and is admonished by his older relatives. He decides to go against all their advice, fall in with a "disreputable" crowd, and eventually drops out.]
military related work [A part of the story is set in future Charles' time during the Second World War where he served as captain in the British armed army. By chance he found himself posted at Brideshead where he would reminisced about bygone days.]
the importance of reputation [Charles was guided by his older cousin at university, and was admonished to care for his reputation. He gleefully let himself fall in with a "disreputable" clique. There were many remarks made about different peoples' reputation, including that of Sebastian, Charles, Anthony Blanche, and Charles' cousin.]
human characters in contrast [A point of the story is arguably to compare and contrast the wealthy and ennobled Marchmain family with various well-to-do middle class people in Britain during the interwar period.]
male homosexuality [Comments were made about the reputation of Anthony Blanche, who was flamboyantly homosexual and had been subjected to such treatments as being dunked in a pond. Sebastian was probably homosexual (as seen in his interactions with Anthony Blanche) though nothing romantic was explicitly made clear about his relationship with Charles.]
World War II [While far removed from the fighting, the opening part of the story is set in England during the days of the Second World War. A point of the story was to show how life in England changed because of it.]
what if I was super rich [Through the eyes of Charles, a middle class boy, the viewer is invited to imagine what it would be like to have the vast fortunes of the Marchmain family at their disposal. Although he played it cool, Charles was clearly dazzled by their opulence.]

:: Minor Themes
master and servant [Charles conversed with his manservant, Lunt, at Oxford several times.]
human occupational activity <barber> [Charles conversed with the old barber while receiving hair dressing services.]
Catholicism [Sebastian was a devout Catholic and Charles was an outspoken atheist. On one occasion Sebastian brought Charles to the family chapel, where Charles kneeled and made the sign of the cross to Sebastian's consternation.]
alcohol abuse [Charles and Sebastian first met after Sebastian drank too much wine and barfed while leaning in through Charles' window. Other scenes of drunken antics followed, foreshadowing Sebastian's ultimate fate.]
mathematics [A group of young ambitious aspiring academics met in Charles' apartments to discuss books on logic.]
grandmother and grandson [Sebastian adored Nanny Hawkins and insisted Charles come and meet her.]
brother and sister [Sebastian expressed disdain for his all-too likeable older sister, Julia.]
mother and son [Sebastian expressed disdain for his mother.]
father and son [Sebastian mentioned his father with something like respect, by stark contrast with how he spoke of his mother. Charles went to live with his father to save money between semesters.]
rich character vs. poor character [Through the eyes of Charles, a middle class young man, the viewer is invited to imagine what it would be like to have the vast fortunes of the Marchmain family at their disposal. Although he played it cool, Charles was clearly dazzled by their opulence. Charles later found himself penniless, though he had the good fortune (unrecognized by Charles) of being able to live with his father.]
human familial relationship [Charles heard sound advice from his older cousin and pointedly rejected it, at Oxford University.]
coping with aging [Charles lamented to himself that he, at the age of 39, was now old.]
coping with a loved one being in peril [Charles hastened to Brideshead upon receiving a telegram from his bosom friend, Sebastian, requesting Charles' immediate presence on account that Sebastian had been "gravely injured". Charles arrived to find that Sebastian had scarcely more than stubbed his toe, and that it was all just a ploy to bring Charles near to him.]

human characters in contrast [A point of the story is arguably to compare and contrast the wealthy and ennobled Marchmain family with various well-to-do middle class people in Britain during the interwar period. Charles was invited to the Brideshead Castle, a palatial mansion, and took in life there with his wealthy host Sebastian.]
father and son [Sebastian mentioned his father with something like respect, by stark contrast with how he spoke of his mother. A major portion of the story concerned Charles and Sebastian meeting Sebastian's father, Lord Marchmain, in Venice. Upon his return, Charles went back to stay with his father to save money between semesters. A portion of the story concerned the psychological game Charles and his father were engaging in while Charles was at home.]
Catholicism [Sebastian was a steadfast Catholic and Charles was an outspoken atheist. There were several conversations that revolved around this faith. The Marchmain's were a minority in having it. They thought Charles was odd for being an agnostic. They lamented that the bishop of London was going to close their family chapel as it had too small a clientele.]
extramarital affair [It was an open secret that Lord Marchmain was living with his mistress in Venice. Charles expressed discomfort about living under the same roof as the adulterous pair, but later came to like them both.]
man and mistress [Lord Marchmain was in Venice, living openly with his Italian mistress, Cara.]
husband and wife [Central to the episode was how Lord Marchmain hated his wife and lived openly with his mistress, Cara, in Venice. Cara explained how and why Lady Marchmain was hated.]
what it is like to travel [This installment of the series follows Charles and Sebastian as they vacation together in Venice. They partook in stereotypical Venice sightseeing activities, such as sharing a gondola and visiting a beach.]
male homosexuality [The question of whether the relationship between Charles and Sebastian is homosexual or platonic is the subject of scholarly debate. In one viewing of the series, the intimacy of their interactions is suggestive of a romantic male friendship in an era defined by internalized homophobia.]

gastronomy [Charles and Sebastian read a book on wine appreciation and sampled numerous expensive bottles of the stuff from the Marchmain cellar.]
faith vs. reason [Charles and Sebastian briefly debated the logic of having faith. Sebastian said he had faith because the ideas were "lovely", which Charles rationally objected to as a silly reason to believe in something.]
atheism [The Marchmain's, devout Catholics, found Charles' expressed atheism or agnosticism peculiar and exotic.]
love [Cara spoke about the Marchmain family and who loved and hated whom.]
coping with being ill and indisposed [The story began with Charles hanging out with Sebastian who was wheelchair-bound due to injuring a tiny bone in his pinky-toe.]
painting [Charles oil painted a mural in the Garden Hall at Brideshead Castle. Charles mentioned the Venetian painter Bellini to Lord Marchmain who pointed out that there were three Venetian painters of that name.]

Charles returns from his art studies in Paris and journeys to Brideshead for
the 1925 New Year's celebration. Sebastian has returned from an excursion to
the Levant with Mr Samgrass, but monochrome slides of the holiday and comments

satisfy his hedonistic needs. Sebastian agrees to participate in a fox hunt
although he plans to make an early escape to a pub, so he asks Charles for
money and his friend acquiesces. When Sebastian returns home heavily
inebriated at the end of the day, a distressed Lady Marchmain questions
Charles. Learning he financed Sebastian's drinking binge, she rebukes him for
enabling him, and Charles leaves Brideshead, fully expecting never to return.

class prejudice in society [Charles and his volunteering upper-middle to upper class friends relished the opportunity to bludgeon some striking lower class workers over their noggins with makeshift batons and other blunt instruments.

alcohol abuse [Charles became reunited with Sebastian in Morocco, only to find him sunken hopelessly deep into alcoholism and various dark emotions.]
romantic relationship issue [Sebastian had gotten himself entangled in what appeared to be a dominance and submission (sic) relationship with a rather despicable German deserter, named Kurt, who had shot himself in the foot and suffered from syphilis.

Sebastian spelled out the reason: he needed someone more pathetic than himself to look after, and Kurt was the only one that could be so pathetic.] {https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_and_submission}

father and son [Charles received a conspicuously chill reception by his unconcerned father upon returning after spending 15 months abroad.]
what it is like to travel [Charles went to Morocco to retrieve Sebastian on behalf of Lady Marchmain. He rode on a stereotypically rickety African bus that was an Air France coach to Casablanca.]
cowardice [Kurt had shot himself in the foot to get out of the German foreign legion.]
greed for riches [Upon hearing that Sebastian had a dying mother, Karl immediately asked if she was rich and whether then she couldn't send him more money so the he, Karl, could live a more luxurious life.]
coping with a moocher [Those who knew Sebastien, but Charles notably, were outraged by how the base and thankless Karl took advantage of his sensitive benefactor.]

Brideshead Deserted

:: Date
1981-12-01

:: Description
Bridey commissions Charles to paint four scenes of Marchmain House in London,
which has been sold to rectify Lord Marchmain's financial difficulties, before
it is demolished to make way for a block of flats. He meets Cordelia again;
she regrets the ongoing dissolution of her family but assures Charles she
continues to find strength in her faith. Cordelia recalls her mother’s reading
of a Father Brown story where G. K. Chesterton's priest catches a thief "with 
an unseen hook and an invisible line which is long enough to let him wander to
the ends of the world and still to bring him back with a twitch upon the
thread". Years pass, and the story resumes with Charles spending two years in
Mexico and Central America painting. He then has an awkward reunion with his
wife Celia in New York City before the two sail home. On board ship, the
Ryders discover Julia is a fellow passenger. Celia is bedridden with chronic
seasickness prompted by extremely rough seas.

growing as a person [] {FD IT seems a point of this episode in particular was to feature how much the various characters had changed and grown over the many intervening years (would be good to figure out how many years) - there were a few discussions that made direct reference to such character developments. Charles said that one must change. Charles and Julia commented on each others' changes.}
disintegrating romantic relationship [Charles and Celia's marriage was gradually coming apart. Charles had lost interest in Celia over the years, and evidently regretted marrying her. Celia knew Charles was becoming increasingly distant, but she was at a loss for what to do about it. Celia, for her part, also expressed misgivings.]
love triangle [A main storyline concerns Charles discretely testing the waters Julia during a transatlantic crossing, all the while with his wife being none the wiser.]

alcoholism [Various remarks were made about Sebastian, the now renowned dipsomaniac.]
the entertainment industry [Celia wanted Charles to meet a film producer that proved to be a remarkably awkward conversation partner to Charles.]
seasickness [Celia became bedridden with seasickness, which gave Charles the perfect opportunity to sneak off and commence a clandestine flirtation with Julia.]
coping with an awkward social gathering [] {prop FD one LM, MO, and Charles can equally empathize with I should think! Better theme name pending.}

Charles and Julia, awaiting their respective divorces, live together,
unmarried, at Brideshead. When Bridey announces his engagement, Julia suggests
he invite his fiancée to Brideshead. Bridey points out that such a highly

long-standing Catholic guilt to Charles.

:: Title
Brideshead Revisited

:: Date
1981-12-22

:: Description
In 1939, World War II is imminent. After years of self-imposed exile in
Venice, the terminally ill Lord Marchmain decides to return home to die.
Appalled by Bridey's choice of a wife, he announces he plans to leave
Brideshead to Julia and Charles. When Bridey brings a priest to visit his very
weak father and perform the last rites, Charles objects vocally, and offends
Julia by harping on the question of what the sacrament actually accomplishes
and what rationale there could be for performing it, especially knowing
Marchmain's aversion to Catholicism. Lord Marchmain sends the priest away,
then meets with his lawyers to change his will. But as Lord Marchmain weakens
to the point of semi-consciousness, he finally accepts the absolution
conditionally pronounced by the priest by making the sign of the Cross.

Tearfully, Julia calls off her marriage to Charles, because she does not wish
"to set up a rival good to God’s". She explains to him "that if I give up this
one thing I want so much, however bad I am, He won't quite despair of me in
the end". Charles, who has been moved by Lord Marchmain's final re-conversion,
understands, but it breaks his heart, too.

The narrative returns to Brideshead in 1944. Charles, apparently now a
believer, genuflects and prays in the reopened chapel which had been closed
since Lady Marchmain's death in 1926. A twitch upon the thread has brought him
to the Faith. The sanctuary lamp, its symbol, burns anew.

facing death [The story concerns Lord Marchmain returning to Brideshead Castle in order to spend his last few months in life there.]
love vs. faith [At the heart of this story is Julia's internal conflict regarding her adulterous desire to be with Charles on the one hand, and her loyalty to the Catholic faith on the other. At the denouement she chose her faith over Charles and told him they would never meet again.]
finding religion [] {PS: Everyone found God in the end.}

:: Major Themes
coping with the death of a parent [The story concerns the Marchmain children, and Julia in particular, handling the slow demise and passing of their esteemed patriarch, Lord Marchmain.]
paramour and paramour [Central to the story is the somewhat unorthodox relationship between the divorced Catholic Julia and the outspoken atheist, Charles. The two intended to get married but knew deep inside that Julia's faith would come between them.]
faith vs. reason [Charles disingenuously defended reason and the supposed well-being of the dying Lord Marchmain against the encroachments of Father Mackay who wished to performed the last rites. Narrator Charles made it clear that his younger self was more concerned about keeping Julia and the the tenuous hold on the Marchmain fortune he had come so close to grasping.] {PS: Not sure the content of the second line is ever made clear.}
gold digging [Charles disingenuously defended reason and the supposed well-being of the dying Lord Marchmain against the encroachments of Father Mackay who wished to performed the last rites. Narrator Charles made it clear that his younger self was more concerned about keeping Julia and the the tenuous hold on the Marchmain fortune he had come so close to grasping.] {PS: How did Narrator Charles make it clear? We should add that since this is getting pretty interpretative.}
coping with a terminal illness [Lord Marchmain was suffering from a terminal heart condition.]

World War II [While far removed from the fighting, the closing part of the story is set in England during the days of the Second World War. A point of the story was to show how life in England changed because of it.]
military related work [A closing part of the story is set in Charles' time during the Second World War where he served as captain in the British armed army. By chance he found himself posted at Brideshead where he would reminisced about bygone days.]
