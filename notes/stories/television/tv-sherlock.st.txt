The Abominable Bride

:: Date
2016-01-01

:: Description
Sherlock, under the influence of drugs, enters his mind palace to solve a case
from Victorian times about a bride shooting herself in the head and rising
from the grave to kill her husband. If he can solve the murder it might lead
him to how Moriarty has risen from the grave after similarly shooting himself
in the head. He solves the case, and concludes that Moriarty is indeed dead,
but "is back".

A Victorian-themed episode, the title of which is based on the quote
("Ricoletti of the club foot and his abominable wife") from "The Adventure of
the Musgrave Ritual", which refers to a case mentioned by Sherlock Holmes. The
episode also alludes to "The Five Orange Pips" and mentions "The Adventure of
the Blue Carbuncle", both from The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.

to narcotics use since Mary's death and unable to clearly distinguish his own
thoughts from reality. He confronts and attacks Smith, and John is forced to
subdue him. While recovering in the hospital, Smith appears in Sherlock's
room, confesses and then tries to kill him. John bursts in just in time to
save Sherlock, who reveals that his behaviour up to that point was not just an
elaborate ploy to expose Smith, but also fulfilling Mary's last wish for him

secret sister, Eurus, and has been using disguises to manipulate both Sherlock
and Watson. The episode ends with Eurus firing a shot at John.

compromised the staff and controls the entire Sherrinford asylum. She subjects
the trio to a series of ordeals, testing their morals by forcing them to
choose which of her victims live and die and ultimately forcing Sherlock to
confront the memory of "Redbeard", a childhood friend whose death set in
motion events that saw Eurus incarcerated. Realising that she will continue to

on an emotional level, offering her the love and relationship with a brother
that she never had, and Eurus stands down. Sherlock and Watson return to the

Street flat to its original lived-in form before meeting a series of unusual
