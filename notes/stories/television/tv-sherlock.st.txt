thoughts from reality. He confronts and attacks Smith, and John is forced to
subdue him. While recovering in the hospital, Smith appears in Sherlock's
room, confesses and then tries to kill him. John bursts in just in time to
save Sherlock, who reveals that his behaviour up to that point was not just an
elaborate ploy to expose Smith, but also fulfilling Mary's last wish for him
to "Save John". Later John's therapist reveals that she is actually Sherlock's
secret sister, Eurus, and has been using disguises to manipulate both Sherlock
and Watson. The episode ends with Eurus firing a shot at John.

Sherlock and Watson – who had been shot with a tranquilizer by Eurus – trick
Mycroft into acknowledging her existence. Eurus steps up her attacks on
Sherlock, culminating in the bombing of his Baker Street apartment. Sherlock,
Watson and Mycroft venture forth to Sherrinford, a maximum-security
psychiatric facility where Eurus is housed. Although Mycroft is skeptical at
the suggestion that she has escaped, the trio discover that Eurus has
compromised the staff and controls the entire Sherrinford asylum. She subjects
the trio to a series of ordeals, testing their morals by forcing them to
choose which of her victims live and die and ultimately forcing Sherlock to
confront the memory of "Redbeard", a childhood friend whose death set in
motion events that saw Eurus incarcerated. Realising that she will continue to
test him until someone he cares for dies, Sherlock tries to connect with her
on an emotional level, offering her the love and relationship with a brother
that she never had, and Eurus stands down. Sherlock and Watson return to the
Baker Street apartment, where they find another message from Mary imploring
them to stay together. A time lapse montage shows them rebuilding the Baker
Street flat to its original lived-in form before meeting a series of unusual
clients.
