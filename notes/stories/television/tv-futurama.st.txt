Reincarnation

:: Date
2011-09-08

:: Description
"Reincarnation" is the 26th and final episode of the sixth season of the
animated sitcom Futurama. It originally aired on Comedy Central on September
8, 2011. This is one of the only episodes not to be animated in its regular
animation style, instead featuring three different segments which each
showcase Futurama "reincarnated" in a different style of animation. The plot
of each segment forms part of an overall story arc, revolving around the
discovery and subsequent destruction of a diamondium comet. A running joke for
the episode involves a key plot point in each segment being obscured by the
specific animation style, though the characters themselves express amazement
over what they see.
