:: Choice Themes
what if I were a god [With his magical model, Jason was as a god unto the little town: he answered suggestion box "prayers", smote the mayor's car; and conjured gold.]

:: Major Themes
letting go of the past [Nichelle told Jason he must move on from his wife's death. Jason leaving his giant gold wedding band to the town was perhaps a sign of him moving on from his dearly departed wife. There might have been an idea that the town must similarly move on (the mayor spoke of moving forwards).]
actions have consequences [The Narrator summed up Jason's catastrophically failed attempts to better the lives of his fellow townspeople as follows: "We can never calculate what change our actions will bring into the world, despite our best intentions, and whether they will be for good or ill."]
superstition in society [A recurring theme was the eagerness of country bumpkins to believe in superstitious things: that the mayor was responsible for the random miracles, that Emilio was a witch.]

:: Minor Themes
power corrupts [Jason did not always the use god-like powers he wielded over the town of Littleton with everyone's best interest in mind. He, for instance, smote the mayor's sports car with a pebble come meteorite from on high out of spite. The Narrator concluded the story by hitting on this point with these words: "Jason Grant wanted to change the world for the better, but the power to do so got the best of him until he lost it all."]
husband and wife [Jason spoke of his late wife Trina.]
coping with the death of a spouse [Jason mourned his late wife Trina.]
finding religion [Jason moved into the church attic in order to come closer to God in the wake of his wife's tragic death.]
Christianity [The story took place in the attic of a church.]
professional politics [We saw a cheesy mayor angling for support.]
political apathy in society [People were seen do be disillusioned with the mayor as he didn't tend to the suggestion box.]
religious occupation [Pastor Nichelle Del Rio was preaching to the townspeople in her church.]
mother and son [Ava and her teen son Emilio.]
drawing [Emilio was making sketches of people and events in the town.]
giant monster [Jason briefly set a giant tarantula on the mayor out of spite.]

:: Choice Themes
what if I repeated a portion of my life over again [It turns out Marc was repeating the same day time and time again, probably for the thousand or so time, and the point of the story was to speculate about what one might do and ought not to do in that situation.]

:: Major Themes
man vs. woman [Marc explained that his behavior was just normal male stuff, and the whole psychopathic-man-pursues-emotional-woman stuff was rather stereotypical. The moral of the story was probably that women ought to punch men in the nose more often.]
the ethics of thinking immoral thoughts [The story turned on the ethical question of whether Claudia was real enough that it was wrong of Marc to treat her badly.]
coping with unwelcome romantic attention [Claudia briefly tried to avoid Marc's attentions in the beginning, then much more so when he became nasty.]
obsessive love [Marc explained to Claudia that he loved her and had repeated the same date with her over a thousand times in an effort to get it just right.]
the human capacity for good and evil [We are made to ponder through Marc's actions toward Claudia the extent to which people will commit acts of evil when there are no repercussions.]
practice makes perfect [Marc quoted this aphorism in relation to his very unique approach to winning over Claudia's love. He moreover illustrated this aphorism by repeating his date with Claudia over 1000 times.]
romantic courtship [The story follows Claudia and Marc as to go on a seemingly impromptu museum date.]

:: Minor Themes
first crush [Claudia mentioned a childhood crush on a boy namer Marc.]
reincarnation [This subject popped up twice in relation to Claudia's research on indigenous masked early on in the story.]
irreverence [Claudia objected to Marc's irreverence for an antique oar in particular.]
flirtation [Claudia and Marc were playfully getting to know each other on a seemingly impromptu museum date.]
what is good and evil [The discussion turned into something philosophical about good and evil. Marc said "what is evil really?".]
female attraction to bad men [Claudia did not challenge Marc's assertion that she'd been attracted to "assholes" in the past.]
