Star Trek: The Animated Series

:: Date
1973-1974

:: Description
Star Trek: The Animated Series (originally known simply as Star Trek but also
known as The Animated Adventures of Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek) is a 1973
animated science fiction television series set in the Star Trek universe
following the events of Star Trek: The Original Series of the 1960s. The
animated series was aired under the name Star Trek, but it has become widely
known under this longer name (or abbreviated as ST: TAS or TAS) to
differentiate it from the original live action series. The success of the
original live action series in syndication, and fan pressure for a Star Trek
revival, led to The Animated Series from 1973–1974, as the source of new
adventures of the Enterprise crew, the next being the live-action feature film
Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979).

1973-09-08

:: Description
While exploring on the outermost rim of the galaxy the USS Enterprise is
pulled into the orbit of a dead star. Trapped there, the crew discovers that
there is an ancient derelict pod ship trapped with them as well. Kirk and crew
beam aboard the huge starship and learn it was once home to an insect race.
They also learn that the ship's crew self-destructed rather than carry a
malevolent entity to other worlds. The entity is still alive and it beams
aboard the Enterprise. Captain Kirk must find a way to get rid of the invader,
without destroying his ship in the process.

More Tribbles, More Troubles

:: Date

:: Description
While the USS Enterprise escorts two robot cargo ships carrying
quintotriticale, a new seed grain, to famine stricken Sherman's Planet, it
encounters a Klingon battlecruiser pursuing a Federation scout ship. When the
Enterprise rescues the pilot, the Klingons attack with a new energy weapon and
demand that the pilot be handed over to them. The pilot turns out to be Cyrano
Jones, an intergalactic trader well known to Kirk and crew from " The Trouble
With Tribbles ". The Klingons desperately want Jones for introducing the
tribble to Klingon planets where it has become a major pest, and for stealing
a glommer, an animal the Klingons were breeding to prey on the tribble. Kirk
expresses sympathy for the Klingons' plight but refuses to hand over Jones, a
Federation citizen. Jones is now selling tribbles genetically engineered to
omit their ordinarily unrestrained multiplicative proclivities. Dr. McCoy
discovers that although Jones' "new" tribbles don't reproduce, they still have
ravenous appetites. Instead of reproducing, they now grow hugely fat. Kirk and
Spock manage to counter the Klingon weapon. Now at a disadvantage, the
Klingons offer to settle for just the glommer. Kirk agrees and returns
it—along with several well-fed (and huge) tribbles that scare it away. McCoy
injects the remaining tribbles on the Enterprise with a serum to slow down
their metabolic rate. They are finally "safe".
