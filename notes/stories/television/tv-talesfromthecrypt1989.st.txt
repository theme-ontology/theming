:: Choice Themes
capital punishment [The death penalty was abolished and subsequently reinstated. The chair being used disproportionately against minorities, the viewer is told. The condemneds' reactions before their respective executions were featured and discussed, the cruelty but also justice therein implied.]

:: Major Themes
facing one's own execution [The story opened with Charley Ledbetter being walked to the electric chair, and culminated with his own executioner, Niles Talbot, sharing in the same fate.]
murder [There was murder left, right and center: 1) Most importantly, the laid off prison executioner Niles electrocuted three people to death and got caught red handed trying to do it to a fourth; 2) Ledbetter was executed for having committed a double murder; 3) the biker gang member Jimmy Flood was acquitted of murder on a minor technicality; 4) circumstances suggested that Theodore Carne killed his wife.]
poetic justice [The laid off prison executioner Niles Talbot was himself executed in the end.]
getting fired from one's job [Niles didn't take it very well when he got caned from his job as prison executioner after 12 years of enthusiastic service. Instead of finding a new line of work, he became a vigilante and went about executing acquitted murder suspects.]
vigilante justice [The laid off prison executioner Niles Talbot took it upon himself to execute acquitted murder suspects.]
serial murder [As a vigilante, Niles Talbot murdered two people by electrocution and was caught red-handed as he tried to murder a third.]
sadism [The viewer is left with the impression that the laid off prison executioner Niles was merely a sadist who enjoyed seeing the fear in people's eyes before electrocuting them. For example, the prison executioner Niles gave Ledbetter's already dead body an extra, and wholly unnecessary, charge of electricity for the fun of it.]
the desire for justice [Niles Talbot became a vigilante, supposedly because he pined to bring justice to the wicked. The viewer is, however, left with the impression that he was merely a sadist who enjoyed seeing the fear in people's eyes before electrocuting them. Niles Talbot saw it as his purpose in life to bring justice to the world by executing the wicked, first as determined by the state, and later by his own judgement.]

:: Minor Themes
living corpse [The story is presented by the Crypt Keeper, a cackling, wisecracking cadaver.]
religious occupation [A prayer reciting priest made the walk with the condemned man Ledbetter to the electric chair. The scene was later repeated with Niles in Ledbetter's shoes.]
desperation [Ledbetter lost his nerve on the walk to the electric chair and began uttering desperate pleas for the execution to be delayed on account that the governor was going to call to stay the execution. Niles later followed in his example down to a tee.]
law enforcement [Ledbetter was walked to the electric chair by two prison guards. The scene was later repeated with Niles in Ledbetter's shoes.]
what it is like in a legal proceeding [A judge demanded order in the court after a remorseless murderer was acquitted on a minor technicality.]
spouse murder [Niles was convinced that Theodore Carne had murdered his own wife to avoid a costly divorce settlement.]
cracking under pressure [Charley lost his composure on his walk to the electric chair, as did Niles later.]
the desire for vengeance [The viewer learns in passing that Charley Ledbetter had shot his boss dead after the boss turned down his request for a raise after having worked at the company for 7 years.]

criminal fraud [Marty attempted to embezzle $1,000,000 of charity money intended for some poor tribe in the Amazons.]
wrestling with one's conscience [Marty being driven mad by his own conscience, which had taken on a persona of its own, is a main novelty of the story.]

husband and wife [The main antagonists George and Luisa Yates were a married couple.]
mental illness [The Yates' thought Mary Jo had gone soft in the head after receiving a blow to it, thinking that the scarecrow wanted to make love to her. The ending suggests that it was all a ruse by Mary Jo, although things are left open to interpretation.]

unrequited love [George lusted after Mary Jo, who was evidently revolted by him.]

:: Choice Themes
be careful what you wish for [Edward longed to be with the aspiring actress Miranda, but (as alluded to in the title) came to deeply regret it when he got his wish, and Miranda wouldn't stop fawning over him every waking moment. Not even after death had failed to do them apart. The Crypt Keeper explicitly spelled out this theme in his introductory remarks. And cracked wise about it in his closing remarks.]

:: Major Themes
infatuation [Edward was initially head over heels and besotted with an actress, named Miranda, who lived in his apartment building.]

clingy girlfriend [Miranda fawned over Edward every waking moment after he used a love potion on her.]
murder of a lover [At his wits end, Edward tried to dispatch his overly clingy love interest, Miranda, by lacing her champagne with a radioactively green glowing poison. However, it was Edward who ended up drinking the lethal brew when Miranda casually switched their glasses with his best intentions in mind.]
attitude of superiority [Miranda looked down her nose at Edward, an undistinguished aspiring screenwriter who somehow had the audacity to barge into her apartment. She flatly told him to come back when he was rich and successful. She disdainfully stood him up for the drinks she had invited him for. She spoke arrogantly on the phone many times, and referred to herself in third person.]

:: Minor Themes
living corpse [The story is presented by the Crypt Keeper, a cackling, wisecracking cadaver.]
nonconsensual voyeurism [Even though Edward inadvertently saw Miranda disrobe in the laundry room, he remained hidden and watched her for longer than what can be accounted as appropriate.]
reclusiveness [One gathers that the landlord Mr. Stronham never left his apartment, judging from his deathly pale complexion and the way he interacted with his tenants via a door installed video camera.]
acting [Miranda was a B-movie actress whose high point, one gathers, was a starring role in "Bimbo Beach Patrol".]
invasion of privacy [The apartment building landlord Mr. Stronham knew intimate details about his tenants, presumably from video surveilling them.]
poison murder [At his wits end, Edward tried to dispatch his overly clingy love interest, Miranda, by lacing her champagne with a radioactively green glowing poison. However, it was Edward who ended up drinking the lethal brew when Miranda casually switched their glasses with his best intentions in mind.]
suicide [Devastated by her lover Edward's sudden death, Miranda jumped from her window to her death - the viewer learns.]
the afterlife [The story concludes with Edward realizing that he was fated to spend eternity in a "Heaven in the Clouds" after world in the company of his clingy, sex-starved, and now horribly disfigured lover, Miranda. Although never spelled out, one viewing of the story is that this was Edward's punishment for having obtained Miranda's love through unscrupulous means in the first place.]
coping with a problematic person [When Edward's water faucet wouldn't come on we realized that the landlord was being stereotypically reluctant to react regarding the issue.]

Yellow

:: Date

:: Description
In 1918, during World War I, General Kalthrob's son, the cowardly Lieutenant
Martin Kalthrob requests a discharge from the army. Martin's father mentions
that while he can't discharge his son, he agrees to transfer him away from the
front if he completes a specific mission. Unfortunately, Martin's cowardice
prevents him from warning the men under his command that German troops are
approaching, and he leaves them all to die while he runs for his life. After
the dying Sergeant Ripper exposes Martin's actions and labels him "yellow",
Martin is arrested, court-martialed, and sentenced to death by firing squad.
The night before Martin's execution, General Kalthrob tells his son that he
has swapped the bullets with blanks, so that Martin can survive the planned
execution and escape to a new life, provided that he faces death with dignity.

Note: This is the only episode of the entire series to run longer than 30
minutes. It is also the first episode featured that was produced as part of
the failed Two-Fisted Tales spinoff. Director Robert Zemekis used this episode
to pay homage to Stanley Kubrick's 1957 film Paths of Glory, which also
starred Kirk Douglas and featured some similar themes. Father-and-son actors
Kirk and Eric Douglas portray father and son on screen.

Austin Haggard, tries to get each of the judges to assign Geraldine to public
service, but he may have ulterior motives.

:: Choice Themes
punishment in the afterlife [The story features the popular notion of a hell-like environment in which sinners are punished in a ironical manner that supposedly befit the crime. Specifically: Geraldine and Austin had, in life, been unscrupulous lawyers. They were therefore made to function, eternally, as lowly defense attorneys in a Kafkaesque courthouse full of perverse laws and sadistic judges. The experience drove Austin to jump at the opportunity to commit suicide.]

:: Major Themes
legal occupation [Geraldine was an ambulance chasing lawyer. Austin was a defense attorney.]
the good of the many vs. the needs of the few [A man couldn't get a pacemaker because Geraldine sued the manufacturer into bankruptcy. This illustrates that the law should not be too quick to take the individual's side in lawsuits, because the wrongful conviction of an innocent company can also cause harm to society. A point of the story was to feature lawyers, such as Geraldine and Austin, who unscrupulously yet within the confines of the law exploit people who have found themselves in legal predicaments of one sort or another. The viewer is made to ponder whether unscrupulous ambulance-chasing lawyers simply parasites on society or do they have a role to fill?]
crime and punishment [The Stueksville justice system meted out draconian punishments for petty criminal offenses.]
corporal punishment [Geraldine objected on legal grounds to the corporal punishments, such as lashings, maimings, and the stocks, that were meted out by the judges in Stueksville.]
cruelty [The three identical looking judges were notorious for handing down harsh sentences for petty criminal offenses. They appeared to have a sadistic streak.]

living corpse [The story is presented by the Crypt Keeper, a cackling, wisecracking cadaver.]
suicide [The experience of Stueksville drove Austin to jump at the opportunity to commit suicide.]
mercy vs. justice [The three justices differed in their opinion regarding the propriety of administering justice with some degrees of leniency.]
capital punishment [Geraldine was eventually sentenced to the electric chair, only to be beaten to it by her meek defense attorney who rushed at it to strap himself in.]

You, Murderer

:: Description
In this unique tale, Lou Spinelli, the corpse of a former criminal-turned
legitimate businessman who, thanks to plastic surgery, bears a striking
resemblance to Humphrey Bogart, reminisces on the set of circumstances that
left him dead, but still able to see, hear, and feel everything around him.
The story, shown entirely from Lou's point of view, involves a plot of greed,
lust, and murder involving his best friend, Oscar Charles, his ex-wife, Betty,
and his lover, Erica, in a morbid homage to classic film noir.

Note: There are numerous references to Bogart's films and career, especially
his famous line "Here's looking at you, kid.", throughout the episode.

:: Major Themes
greed for riches [The viewer is led to believe that Kate was intent on running off with a large sum of money from her husband's safe.]
husband and wife [Malcolm and Kate's marriage was fueled in part by a common interest in surgically augmenting people with animal abilities.]
problem gambling [Glynn would have never ended up half-owl had he kept his gambling under control.]
coping with being in debt [Glynn was hard up to pay a gambling debt he owed to a high-level gangster.]
super hearing [Glynn was surgically implanted with an owl's auditory system.]
how to crack a safe [The viewer is shown the expert safe cracker Glynn Fennell at work.]
human-animal hybrid [Glynn was surgically implanted with the auditory system of an owl. In the end, he took on other owl characteristics. Kate had been surgically implanted with feline parts, including vertical slit eyes. This ended up rewarding her with nine lives.]
murder [Malcolm was about to have Glynn killed but was implored to stay his hand by Kate. The story ended with KAte and Malcolm about to have their surgeon murder Glynn to purloin his auditory system.]

:: Minor Themes
living corpse [The story is presented by the Crypt Keeper, a cackling, wisecracking cadaver.]
coping with being tortured [A gangster had Glynn tied down to a snooker table spread-eagle and beat over the abdomen with a cue. This was in regard to coming to an equitable arrangement over an unpaid debt.]
compassion [Kate urged her gangster husband, Malcolm, to spare Glynn's life in what seemed to be an act of compassion. In reality, it was all an act as Kate and Malcolm were in cahoots.]
romantic infidelity [Kate seduced Glynn. Little did Glynn know that her husband, Malcolm, was watching on with an air of approval.]
coping with a disability [Glynn's poor hearing compromised his ability to crack safes.]
medical occupation [An eccentric doctor implanted Glynn with the auditory system of an owl.]
the dangers of smoking [Glynn heard Kate's heart race after she took a drag from her cigarette. His subsequent advice to her to give up smoking was not well received.]
what if I underwent a physical metamorphosis [The story concluded with Glynn partially transforming into an owl: His head spun around and his face fell off to be replaced with a beak.]
organ theft [] {MO: I believe the final dialogue implied that they were testing out implanted animal organs on innocent people and then killing those people in order to steal the implanted organs if the procedure was otherwise successful.}
sex addiction [] {prop FD: a human addiction, or just nymphomania, as Kate explained to Glynn that she craved sex to an extreme degree.}
