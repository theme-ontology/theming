:: Choice Themes
capital punishment [The death penalty was abolished and subsequently reinstated. The chair being used disproportionately against minorities, the viewer is told. The condemneds' reactions before their respective executions were featured and discussed, the cruelty but also justice therein implied.]

:: Major Themes
facing one's own execution [The story opened with Charley Ledbetter being walked to the electric chair, and culminated with his own executioner, Niles Talbot, sharing in the same fate.]
murder [There was murder left, right and center: 1) Most importantly, the laid off prison executioner Niles electrocuted three people to death and got caught red handed trying to do it to a fourth; 2) Ledbetter was executed for having committed a double murder; 3) the biker gang member Jimmy Flood was acquitted of murder on a minor technicality; 4) circumstances suggested that Theodore Carne killed his wife.]
poetic justice [The laid off prison executioner Niles Talbot was himself executed in the end.]
getting fired from one's job [Niles didn't take it very well when he got caned from his job as prison executioner after 12 years of enthusiastic service. Instead of finding a new line of work, he became a vigilante and went about executing acquitted murder suspects.]
vigilante justice [The laid off prison executioner Niles Talbot took it upon himself to execute acquitted murder suspects.]
serial murder [As a vigilante, Niles Talbot murdered two people by electrocution and was caught red-handed as he tried to murder a third.]
sadism [The viewer is left with the impression that the laid off prison executioner Niles was merely a sadist who enjoyed seeing the fear in people's eyes before electrocuting them. For example, the prison executioner Niles gave Ledbetter's already dead body an extra, and wholly unnecessary, charge of electricity for the fun of it.]
the desire for justice [Niles Talbot became a vigilante, supposedly because he pined to bring justice to the wicked. The viewer is, however, left with the impression that he was merely a sadist who enjoyed seeing the fear in people's eyes before electrocuting them. Niles Talbot saw it as his purpose in life to bring justice to the world by executing the wicked, first as determined by the state, and later by his own judgement.]

:: Minor Themes
living corpse [The story is presented by the Crypt Keeper, a cackling, wisecracking corpse.]
religious occupation [A prayer reciting priest made the walk with the condemned man Ledbetter to the electric chair. The scene was later repeated with Niles in Ledbetter's shoes.]
desperation [Ledbetter lost his nerve on the walk to the electric chair and began uttering desperate pleas for the execution to be delayed on account that the governor was going to call to stay the execution. Niles later followed in his example down to a tee.]
law enforcement [Ledbetter was walked to the electric chair by two prison guards. The scene was later repeated with Niles in Ledbetter's shoes.]
what it is like in a legal proceeding [A judge demanded order in the court after a remorseless murderer was acquitted on a minor technicality.]
spouse murder [Niles was convinced that Theodore Carne had murdered his own wife to avoid a costly divorce settlement.]
cracking under pressure [Charley lost his composure on his walk to the electric chair, as did Niles later.]
the desire for vengeance [The viewer learns in passing that Charley Ledbetter had shot his boss dead after the boss turned down his request for a raise after having worked at the company for 7 years.]

while he runs for his life. After the dying Sergeant Ripper (Lance Henriksen)
exposes Martin's actions and labels him "yellow", Martin is arrested, court-
