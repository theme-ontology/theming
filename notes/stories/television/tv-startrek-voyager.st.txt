==============================

:: Title
Star Trek: Voyager

:: Date
1995-2001

:: Description
Star Trek: Voyager is a science fiction television series set in the Star Trek
universe that debuted in 1995 and ended its original run in 2001, with a
classic "ship in space" formula like the preceding Star Trek: The Original
Series (TOS) and Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG).

The series takes place during the years 2371 to 2378. It follows the
adventures of the Starfleet vessel USS Voyager, which becomes stranded in the
Delta Quadrant (on the far side of the Milky Way galaxy, 70,000 light-years
from Earth) while searching for a renegade Maquis ship. Voyager has to make
the estimated 75-year journey home.

The series was created by Rick Berman, Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor, and is
the fifth incarnation of Star Trek, which began with the original Star Trek
series that was created by Gene Roddenberry. Voyager was produced for seven
seasons, from 1995 to 2001, and is the first Star Trek TV series with a female
captain, Kathryn Janeway (played by Kate Mulgrew), as the lead character.
Berman served as head executive producer in charge of the overall production
for the series during its entire run. He was assisted by a second in command
executive producer who generally functioned as the day-to-day showrunner. Four
were used throughout the series' run: Michael Piller (EP/showrunner – first
and second season), Jeri Taylor (EP – first through fourth seasons, showrunner
– third and fourth seasons), Brannon Braga (EP/showrunner – fifth and sixth
seasons), and Kenneth Biller (EP/showrunner – seventh season). Star Trek:
Voyager aired on UPN and was the network's second-longest-running series. UPN
itself would end its production run in 2006.
