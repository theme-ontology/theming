tvseries: The Ray Bradbury Theater (1985)
=========================================

:: Title
The Ray Bradbury Theater

:: Date
1985-1992

:: Description
The Ray Bradbury Theatre is an anthology series that ran for three seasons on
First Choice Superchannel in Canada and HBO in the United States from 1985 to
1986, and then on USA Network, running for four additional seasons from 1988
to 1992; episodes aired on the Global Television Network in Canada from 1991
to 1994. It was shown in reruns on the Sci Fi Channel and later on the Retro
Television Network.

Many of the episodes focused on only one of Bradbury's original works.
However, Bradbury occasionally included elements from his other works.
"Marionettes, Inc." featured Fantoccini, a character from "I Sing the Body
Electric!". "Gotcha!" included an opening sequence taken from "The Laurel and
Hardy Love Affair". Characters were renamed, and elements added to the
original works to expand the story to 23–28 minutes or to better suit the
television medium.

Each episode would begin with a shot of Bradbury in his office, gazing over
mementos of his life, which he states (in narrative) are used to spark ideas
for stories. During the first season, Bradbury sometimes appeared on-screen in
brief vignettes introducing the story. During the second season, Bradbury
provided the opening narration with no specific embellishment concerning the
episode. During the third season, a foreshortened version of the narration was
used and Bradbury would add specific comments relevant to the episode
presented. During the fourth and later seasons, a slightly shorter generic
narration was used with no additional comments.

:: Choice Themes
killing an artificial person [The viewer is made to ponder whether George Hill should be punished for killing an android replica of his unfaithful wife.]

:: Major Themes
facing one's own execution [George Hill was on death row for the murder of an android copy of his unfaithful wife. The story is set on the evening of George's execution, and the story is told from his point of view.]
spouse murder [George Hill was sentenced to death for murdering an android copy of his unfaithful wife, Katherine. For part of the story, it was unclear as to whether George had murdered his real wife or her android replica.]
android clone of a person [George Hill murdered an android replica of his unfaithful wife, Katherine.]
husband and wife [The story turns on George catching his conspicuously younger wife, Katherine, with another man. George dealt with the blow by ordering the construction of an android replica of her, which he then killed.]
extramarital affair [Katherine's husband, George, caught her in the act with her young lover. George dealt with the blow by ordering the construction of an android replica of her, which he then killed.]
young and old romance [The story turns on George catching his conspicuously younger wife, Katherine, with another man. George dealt with the blow by ordering the construction of an android replica of her, which he then killed.]
dysfunctional legal system [Irrespective of what the viewer or anyone may think about AI rights, it is clear that George at the time thought he was doing nothing wrong and was openly helped along by a major corporation, Marriotts Inc. That this could happen and he was then subsequently sentenced to death in a reality show-like trial because of a law that had been whimsically passed is unequivocally a travesty of legislative and judicial process, as George's outraged reaction also implies.]
the desire for vengeance [George sought to avenge himself, at least in his own fantasy, on his cheating young wife by constructing and murdering a perfect replica of her. Alas, the plan backfired on him in a most major way. He was executed and she inherited his fortune, which she planned to share with her lover.]
catharsis [If one takes the detached view that the android replica was a mere object, as George and much of his society had evidently done up until that point, George's plan was just to vent his pent up anger and frustration harmlessly by turning some expensive artifice into rubble, and nothing more.]
capital punishment [George was sentenced to death for the murder of an android replica of his wife. The story ended with his imminent execution.]

television as a control mechanism [The story is set in a future where people are accustomed to remain indoors in their air-conditioned homes and watch television. Although the reason was never spelled out, one must consider whether this was a strategy used by the rules (who may have been machines) to keep the public dumbed-down.]
machine controlled society [The story featured a supposed utopian society in which it seemed that machines took care of public affairs and people were left to sit in their air-conditioned homes watching reruns on their TVs. Other hints were dropped that the society was run by machines.

:: Choice Themes
ecological destruction [At the center of the story was the idea that the space explorers had stumbled upon a virtual paradise, yet one of them in particular was bent on destroying it for the sake of mining metals. It was implied that financial interests on Earth would likely do the same, and so the remaining explorers came up with the idea to lie about the planet being safe in order to keep more humans from coming.]
living planet [The story revolves around a group of space explorers who discover a planet that caters to the every desire of the pure of heart. The planet evidently felt pain when Chatterton started drilling into it. Driscoll speculated that the planet was alive, and moreover that its purpose was to make people happy.]

:: Choice Themes

:: Major Themes
aunt and nephew [Cora's nephew, Benjy, spent the summer with her at her at Tom's farmhouse.]
pridefulness [Receiving mail was evidently a point of pride in the rural community where the story is set. It was in this context that Cora was eager to outdo her solitary neighbor, Mrs. Brabbam, when it came to getting letters stuffed in her mailbox. Cora was initially gleeful when the mail started flooding in. But she ultimately took pity on Mrs. Brabbam after it came to light that Mrs. Brabbham had been faking getting mail for years.]
neighbor and neighbor [Cora was determined to upstage her solitary neighbor, Mrs. Brabbam, by receiving the most mail out of the two of them.]
illiteracy in society [Benjy wrote letters for Cora because she couldn't even read her own name. The story concluded with Cora receiving a simple letter from Benjy that included a drawing of a pencil together with the word "pencil". This, coupled with Benjy's assurance in the letter that he would write Cora very week, suggests that he intended to teach her how to read through their future correspondences.]

:: Minor Themes
creative writing [In the introduction, Ray Bradbury shared with the viewer the wellsprings of creativity that inspire his writing.]
the nature of creativity [In his introduction, Ray Bradbury gave his viewers an intimate window into his writing room, and some of the self-professed sources of creativity that lay about within it.]
husband and wife [Cora's husband, Tom, was kicking around the house.]
loneliness [It came to light that Mrs. Brabbham ventured out to her mailbox each morning to collect the same tattered old letters. This was to give the appearance that she was regularly receiving mail from her loved ones. In reality she lived by herself in an old farmhouse, where one gathers she was deeply isolated and alone.]
coping with saying goodbye forever [Benjy bid a sentimental farewell to his aunt, Cora, after spending the summer at her farmhouse.]
remorse [Cora came to regret one-upping Mrs. Brabbam when it came to receiving lots of mail.]

:: Major Themes
husband and wife [The story turns on Walter and Leota Bean spending a night in a hotel room that was being used to store a black marble tombstone. Leota was spooked by the presence of the tombstone. Walter, by contrast, was content to put it out of his mind and get some much needed shut eye.]
fear [Leota was spooked by the presence of a black marble tombstone in the middle of her and Walter's hotel room.]
superstitiousness [Leota refused to accept that the tombstone in her and Walter's hotel room was merely being stored there for future use. Instead, she reasoned that it was connected to a spirit, and performed a ritual to put the spirit at ease. Walter, by contrast, was content to put the tombstone out of his mind and get some much needed shut eye.]
murder [] {PS: Seems there was some nefarious plot to murder Mr. White.}
