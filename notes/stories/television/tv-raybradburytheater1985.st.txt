tvseries: The Ray Bradbury Theater (1985)
=========================================

:: Title
The Ray Bradbury Theater

:: Date
1985-1992

:: Description
The Ray Bradbury Theatre is an anthology series that ran for three seasons on
First Choice Superchannel in Canada and HBO in the United States from 1985 to
1986, and then on USA Network, running for four additional seasons from 1988
to 1992; episodes aired on the Global Television Network in Canada from 1991
to 1994. It was shown in reruns on the Sci Fi Channel and later on the Retro
Television Network.

Many of the episodes focused on only one of Bradbury's original works.
However, Bradbury occasionally included elements from his other works.
"Marionettes, Inc." featured Fantoccini, a character from "I Sing the Body
Electric!". "Gotcha!" included an opening sequence taken from "The Laurel and
Hardy Love Affair". Characters were renamed, and elements added to the
original works to expand the story to 23–28 minutes or to better suit the
television medium.

Each episode would begin with a shot of Bradbury in his office, gazing over
mementos of his life, which he states (in narrative) are used to spark ideas
for stories. During the first season, Bradbury sometimes appeared on-screen in
brief vignettes introducing the story. During the second season, Bradbury
provided the opening narration with no specific embellishment concerning the
episode. During the third season, a foreshortened version of the narration was
used and Bradbury would add specific comments relevant to the episode
presented. During the fourth and later seasons, a slightly shorter generic
narration was used with no additional comments.

android clone of a person [The story turns on Mr. Brailing purchasing an android replica of himself to keep his nagging wife occupied while he enjoyed the good life.]

:: Major Themes
husband and wife [The story turns on Mr. Brailing purchasing an android replica of himself to keep his nagging wife occupied while he enjoyed the good life.]
feeling tied down in a relationship [The story turns on Mr. Brailing purchasing an android replica of himself to keep his nagging wife occupied while he enjoyed the good life.]
coping with a problematic family member [The story turns on Mr. Brailing purchasing an android replica of himself to keep his nagging wife occupied while he enjoyed the good life.]
money isn't everything [A point of the story was that an android clone, which would liberate you from domestic drudgery, would cost all of your life's savings. The fact that three different characters were tempted by the offer illustrates that there are arguably pleasures in life worth more than your financial security.]
a person and their clone [The grand denouement of the story is that Mr. Brailing confronted his own clone about usurping his life, but was defeated and possibly killed by it. The clone had concluded that Mr. Brailing was crude, unfeeling, and wholly undeserving of his wife.]
pervasive marketing in society [The Marionettes company practically stalked Mr. Brailing in order to make him purchase a clone. Mr. Brailing confronted them about it and prodded into their methods, before he became obsessed with buying the clone.]

:: Minor Themes
creative writing [In the introduction, Ray Bradbury shared with the viewer the wellsprings of creativity that inspire his writing.]
the nature of creativity [In his introduction, Ray Bradbury gave his viewers an intimate window into his writing room, and some of the self-professed sources of creativity that lay about within it.]
friendship [Mr. Brailing urged his friend from the bar to follow in his example by splurging on an android duplicate.]
murder [The story concludes with Mr. Brailing's android replica killing him and assuming his identity.] {For discussion: PS guesses he killed him...}
what if I found out that a loved one was not the person I thought they were [Brailing told a friend from the bar about the androids, and that they had peculiar sounding mechanical hearts. Intrigued, the friend went home to mull it over only to find that his bothersome wife was, in fact, an android herself.]
coping with a nag [] {FD: the definition doesn't quite fit but I note that the word "nagging" was used above}
