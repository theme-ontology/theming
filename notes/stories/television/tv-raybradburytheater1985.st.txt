tvseries: The Ray Bradbury Theater (1985)
=========================================

:: Title
The Ray Bradbury Theater

:: Date
1985-1992

:: Description
The Ray Bradbury Theatre is an anthology series that ran for three seasons on
First Choice Superchannel in Canada and HBO in the United States from 1985 to
1986, and then on USA Network, running for four additional seasons from 1988
to 1992; episodes aired on the Global Television Network in Canada from 1991
to 1994. It was shown in reruns on the Sci Fi Channel and later on the Retro
Television Network.

Many of the episodes focused on only one of Bradbury's original works.
However, Bradbury occasionally included elements from his other works.
"Marionettes, Inc." featured Fantoccini, a character from "I Sing the Body
Electric!". "Gotcha!" included an opening sequence taken from "The Laurel and
Hardy Love Affair". Characters were renamed, and elements added to the
original works to expand the story to 23–28 minutes or to better suit the
television medium.

Each episode would begin with a shot of Bradbury in his office, gazing over
mementos of his life, which he states (in narrative) are used to spark ideas
for stories. During the first season, Bradbury sometimes appeared on-screen in
brief vignettes introducing the story. During the second season, Bradbury
provided the opening narration with no specific embellishment concerning the
episode. During the third season, a foreshortened version of the narration was
used and Bradbury would add specific comments relevant to the episode
presented. During the fourth and later seasons, a slightly shorter generic
narration was used with no additional comments.

:: Choice Themes
killing an artificial person [The viewer is made to ponder whether George Hill should be punished for killing an android replica of his unfaithful wife.]

:: Major Themes
facing one's own execution [George Hill was on death row for the murder of an android copy of his unfaithful wife. The story is set on the evening of George's execution, and the story is told from his point of view.]
spouse murder [George Hill was sentenced to death for murdering an android copy of his unfaithful wife, Katherine. For part of the story, it was unclear as to whether George had murdered his real wife or her android replica.]
android clone of a person [George Hill murdered an android replica of his unfaithful wife, Katherine.]
husband and wife [The story turns on George catching his conspicuously younger wife, Katherine, with another man. George dealt with the blow by ordering the construction of an android replica of her, which he then killed.]
extramarital affair [Katherine's husband, George, caught her in the act with her young lover. George dealt with the blow by ordering the construction of an android replica of her, which he then killed.]
young and old romance [The story turns on George catching his conspicuously younger wife, Katherine, with another man. George dealt with the blow by ordering the construction of an android replica of her, which he then killed.]
dysfunctional legal system [Irrespective of what the viewer or anyone may think about AI rights, it is clear that George at the time thought he was doing nothing wrong and was openly helped along by a major corporation, Marriotts Inc. That this could happen and he was then subsequently sentenced to death in a reality show-like trial because of a law that had been whimsically passed is unequivocally a travesty of legislative and judicial process, as George's outraged reaction also implies.]
the desire for vengeance [George sought to avenge himself, at least in his own fantasy, on his cheating young wife by constructing and murdering a perfect replica of her. Alas, the plan backfired on him in a most major way. He was executed and she inherited his fortune, which she planned to share with her lover.]
catharsis [If one takes the detached view that the android replica was a mere object, as George and much of his society had evidently done up until that point, George's plan was just to vent his pent up anger and frustration harmlessly by turning some expensive artifice into rubble, and nothing more.]
capital punishment [George was sentenced to death for the murder of an android replica of his wife. The story ended with his imminent execution.]

:: Choice Themes
vengeance from beyond the grave	[Charles rigged a contraption, recorded himself, and set events in motion in such a way that after his death and in a manner of speaking, his recorded self would be there to gloat while his carefully planned scheme for revenge on his younger brother, Richard, came to fruition: Richard would be tricked and enticed into lying down in the coffin which would then activate, reveal legs to take, and walk outside to quite literally bury Richard alive.]

robot helper [Charles' house abounded in autonomous semi-intelligent mechanical servants that did such chores as answering the door, dusting, pouring the whiskey, and spectating at the premature inhumation of pesky younger brothers.]
coping with a moocher [Richard had had mooched things like booze, cars, and gambling money off of his late mother. He also helped himself to whisky and other comforts around his older brother's house despite being told to leave.]
curiosity killed the cat [As Charles knew he would, Richard couldn't resist the temptation to activate the mysterious coffin. He laid down in the place indicated. Thus he sealed his own fate when the coffin activated a sequence of pre-programmed events that would culminate with Richard's living inhumation. Meanwhile, Charles' recording then activated to gloat at Richard's fate.]

alcohol abuse [Charles indicated that Richard was penniless in part because he was too keen on the hootch.]

vanity [Mr. Clarence was at first outraged when he figure out that the clay T-Rex was created in his own image, but he quickly came around when told that the film was an homage to his greatness.

:: Major Themes
death incarnate	[Four men carrying a wicker basket, and their leader in particular, seemed to represent the Grim Reaper in all but appearance.]
ghost [Upon refusing to go with the man with the wicker basket, Aunt Tildy evidently became somewhat incorporeal in the manner of a ghost, albeit not invisible. She also threatened to "haunt" the people who had carried off her body, demonstrating that she thought of herself in such terms.]

:: Major Themes
the desire to be more like a normal person [Mr. Bigelow, who was diminutive in statue, longed to be the size of a normal man, if not larger. This is evidenced by his 1) habit of frequenting a hall of mirrors, where he would pose in front of a mirror that exaggerated his height; 2) writing of a story about being a 7 foot tall man; and 3) living in a miniature house that made him feel large.]

:: Choice Themes
miracle [The story concerns a supernatural mirage of seemingly divine origin that was dubbed a miracle by the main characters. The mirage appeared to different people as whatever place their secret inner self yearned for. Thus it appeared to one as San Fransisco, two others as Paris, and another even as a fantastical version of Xanadu of yore.]

:: Major Themes
the inclination to believe what one wants to believe [One interpretation of the story is that the wondrous mirage was real and that people saw in it the place they most yearned to be.]
greed [Ned was exceedingly greedy about profiting from the wondrous mirage. William's greed to make a profit from charging passersby to see the wondrous mirage was juxtaposed with his partner, Robert's compulsion to let everyone view it for free.]
stereotypically innocent character [In the end the wondrous mirage came back because two innocent children believed in it. By stark contrast, it vanished before more cynical characters, like Ned.]
carefree way of life [Robert and William were a pair of happy-go-lucky drifters.]
awe	[The story makes a point of illustrating how awestruck various people were, or in a few cases were not, by the miraculous mirage.]

the need for closure [It seems the point of the story was to illustrate that Douglas got closure by returning to the lake and finishing the ruined sandcastle, which somehow summoned the corpse of his childhood crush who had drowned 25 years earlier.]

:: Major Themes
young lovers [The story concerns two prepubescent kids who fell in love.]
fear of open waters	[Douglas had a pathological fear of the lake, as alluded to in the title, which he thought hated people.]
coping with the death of a lover [Douglas was so distressed when his crush, Tally, perished in the lake that he demolished half the sandcastle they had built together. Twenty-five years later he felt the need to revisit the site of her death.]
reminiscence about one's youth [Much of the story is told as adult Douglas thinking back to the summer he spent together with his childhood crush.]
human childhood [Ten-year-old Douglas spent an idyllic summer making sandcastles on the shore of Lake Michigan together with his crush, Tally. The summer ended in tragedy, however, when Tally disappeared in the lake.

personal haunting [The Premise of the story is that Allin was haunted by a supernatural entity, or several, referred to as the winds. Allin believed he had upset the wind by discovering its place of origin in the Himalayas some years ago.] {MO: the definition as written fits, but the parent theme is not strictly accurate as we don't know that this wind was a ghost.

The story pointedly finished with the implication that Eckels had caused a preset-day political change, in favor of fascism, in the country by accidentally stepping on a butterfly in the Jurassic era, thus illustrating the Butterfly effect somewhat literally.]

:: Major Themes
