:: Description
The Cleopatras is a 1983 BBC Television eight-part historical drama serial. Written by Philip Mackie, it is set in Ancient Egypt during the latter part of the Ptolemaic Dynasty with an emphasis on the Cleopatras. Intended to be the I, Claudius of the 1980s, The Cleopatras met with a decidedly mixed critical reaction, and was regarded and portrayed as a gaudy farce. It also produced a number of complaints due to scenes of nudity.

:: Description
Alexandria, 145 BC. Upon the death in battle of her husband and brother King Ptolemy VI, Queen Cleopatra II has to marry her younger brother, Ptolemy, to remain on the throne. Ptolemy secretly orders the murder of his nephew and heir, Eupator, the son of his wife and their brother, the late King, then impregnates his new wife with a new child (it turns out to be a boy, whom they call Memphites), and then rapes Eupator's sister, his step-daughter and niece Cleopatra III, his wife's own daughter, who becomes pregnant by him, so he decides to divorce her mother and marries her instead. They rule as an uneasy triumvirate. Ptolemy and Cleopatra III are driven out of Egypt by the mob. Ptolemy takes revenge on his sister Cleopatra II by murdering their only son Memphites, his sister's only male child and heir, and sending her his dismembered corpse as a birthday present.

life in the ancient Greco-Roman world [The story is set in the royal court of Alexandria in 145 BC.]
courtly intrigues [The plot turns on people jockeying for power in the royal court of Alexandria in 145 BC. In particular, Potbelly was Machiavellian in his efforts to secure his hold on power, Cleopatra II reestablished herself on the throne after Potbelly was driven out from Alexandria, and Cleopatra III betrayed her own mother to become queen.]
incest in society [The viewer is confronted with the prevailing norm among the Alexandrian royals of marrying within the family to preserve the royal line.]
incestuous relationship [Cleopatra II married her younger brother, Potbelly, following the death of her husband and brother, King Ptolemy VI. Potbelly married his step-daughter and niece, Cleopatra III.]

:: Minor Themes
superseded scientific theory [In the opening credits, a Ptolemaic-era intellectual explained how people used to think the earth was flat, or tortoise-shaped, whereas as nowadays he and his ilk knew the earth was round, and moreover sat at the center of the cosmos.]
humanity's place in the universe [In the opening credits, a Ptolemaic-era intellectual articulated the prevailing bit of wisdom that Egypt sits (perhaps metaphorically) at the center of the earth, just as the earth itself was thought to sit at the center of the cosmos.]
master and slave [The royal court waited on hand and foot by house slaves.]
political assassination [Shortly after being crowned Pharaoh, Potbelly arranged for his nephew and heir, Eupator, to be bludgeoned to death in his bed, thereby eliminating a rival for the throne and securing his hold on power.]
exile [Potbelly ordered that Eupator's tutor and servants be exiled from Egypt for failing to protect the boy from assassination. Cleopatra III floated the idea of having her mother exiled.]
official scapegoating in society [Potbelly had Eupator assassinated and blamed it on the Jews of Alexandria.]
antisemitism [Potbelly disingenuously blamed the Jews of Alexandria for Euptor's assassination. As punishment, he ordered that they be gathered in a public square and trampled by elephants. It was not clear, however, whether his order was carried out.]
sexual assault [Potbelly raped his step-daughter, and niece, Cleopatra III.]
romantic infidelity [Potbelly briefly courted his step-daughter, Cleopatra III, before raping and then marrying her.]
caring for a baby [Potbelly ill-advisedly insisted that his newborn son be put on a diet of meat and rice.]
diplomacy [Scipio Africanus visited the Alexandria court on a diplomatic mission from Rome.]
bribery [Scipio Africanus politely declined Potbelly's various bribes. Although, not made clear, Scipio may have relented by accepting a bribe of boys.]
revolution in society [Potbelly and his court fled Alexandria following civil unrest that culminated with a violent "mob" storming the palace.] {For discussion}
filicide [Potbelly took revenge on his sister Cleopatra II by murdering their only son Memphites, his sister's only male child and heir, and sending her his dismembered corpse as a birthday present.]
