:: Description
The Cleopatras is a 1983 BBC Television eight-part historical drama serial. Written by Philip Mackie, it is set in Ancient Egypt during the latter part of the Ptolemaic Dynasty with an emphasis on the Cleopatras. Intended to be the I, Claudius of the 1980s, The Cleopatras met with a decidedly mixed critical reaction, and was regarded and portrayed as a gaudy farce. It also produced a number of complaints due to scenes of nudity.

:: Minor Themes
superseded scientific theory [In the opening credits, a Ptolemaic-era intellectual explained how people used to think the earth was flat, or tortoise-shaped, whereas as nowadays he and his ilk knew the earth was round, and moreover sat at the center of the cosmos.]
humanity's place in the universe [In the opening credits, a Ptolemaic-era intellectual articulated the prevailing bit of wisdom that Egypt sits (perhaps metaphorically) at the center of the earth, just as the earth itself was thought to sit at the center of the cosmos.]
master and slave [The royal court waited on hand and foot by house slaves.]

official scapegoating in society [Potbelly had Eupator assassinated and blamed it on the Jews of Alexandria.]
antisemitism [Potbelly disingenuously blamed the Jews of Alexandria for Euptor's assassination. As punishment, he ordered that they be gathered in a public square and trampled by elephants. It was not clear, however, whether his order was carried out.]
sexual assault [Potbelly raped his step-daughter, and niece, Cleopatra III.]
romantic infidelity [Potbelly briefly courted his step-daughter, Cleopatra III, before raping and then marrying her.]
caring for a baby [Potbelly ill-advisedly insisted that his newborn son be put on a diet of meat and rice.]

:: Description
Ptolemy and Cleopatra III re-invade Egypt, banishing Cleopatra II to Syria, where her daughter Cleopatra Thea is queen consort, but is constantly displeased with the reign of her incompetent husband, King Demetrius. Cleopatra seeks the aid of Demetrius in regaining her throne, but when he fails, his wife orders his slaughter in a temple where he has sought refuge. Her intention is to proclaim herself queen regnant, and her favourite younger son Grypus a puppet co-ruler, but she is forestalled by her elder son Seleucus, who proclaims himself king instead, allowing her to be only the Queen Mother of Syria. She tries to make a puppet ruler of him instead, but when he resists her influence she poisons him at the dinner table. After his death, Grypus finally becomes King of Syria, but with time comes to dislike his mother's increasing desire for power and influence over him.

Meanwhile, Ptolemy announces a sudden change of character - henceforth he is to be known as Ptolemy the Benign. He makes up with his sister Cleopatra II and allows her to return to Egypt from Syria and be a queen once more, much to the dislike of his wife and co-ruler, Queen Cleopatra III, who still sees her mother as a rival. Cleopatra III and Ptolemy's eldest son and daughter, Chickpea and Cleopatra IV, get married, again to Cleopatra's great dislike (because they are in love with each other, but she hates him because he is a product of rape), and their second daughter, Cleopatra Tryphaena, is married to her cousin Grypus, who then, persuaded by her, begins to resist his mother's influence. When his mother tries to kill him, he forces her to drink the poison and she dies.
