:: Date
2018-08-17

:: Description
Princess Tiabeanie "Bean" is the roughhousing princess of Dreamland, unhappily
destined to marry Prince Guysbert, son of the incestuous king and queen of
Bentwood. Looking through her wedding gifts, Bean finds a demon named Luci who
was sent by two dark mages hoping to turn Bean to evil. Luci ends up being a
fun-loving troublemaker who sympathizes with Bean's predicament as she feels
that the marriage is simply a grab for more power by her father King Zøg.
Meanwhile, Elfo, an optimistic elf, disillusioned with his candy-making happy
life, leaves the elf realm much to the consternation of his people. Elfo
arrives in time to witness Bean turn down Guysbert who unfortunately impales
himself on a sword. Bean, Elfo, and Luci escape while Prince Merkimer, next in
line to marry Bean, and his men chase after her. The group is directed by a
fairy to the Wishmaster, who turns out to be the Washmaster, and hopelessly
surrounded, they fall backwards off a cliff.

For Whom the Pig Oinks

:: Date

:: Description
Bean, Elfo, and Luci are "rescued" by Merkimer who takes them back to
Dreamland. Elfo is taken in by Sorcerio who wants to use his blood to create
more magic and so Zøg can gain the elixir of life. At Luci's suggestion, Bean
approaches Merkimer with the idea of having a bachelor party before the
marriage. She also discovers Zøg and Sorcerio's plan to drain Elfo of his
blood so they use pig's blood to fool them. At the bachelor party, the entire
crew travels to mermaid island in the hopes that Merkimer will be killed by
the mermaids. He is instead taken in by walruses who save them from murderous
Borcs, though they turn out to be the allied Bozaks. Bean ultimately loses
hope; however, a thirsty Merkimer discovers the "elf blood" which is mostly
pig's blood and Elfo convinces him to drink it transforming him into a pig.
Bean, fed up, denounces the marriage and Zøg finally agrees with his daughter.
This upsets the king of Bentwood and he and Zøg settle things in a fistfight
with Bean, Elfo, and Luci happily watching.

:: Description
Bean once again sneaks off with Elfo and Luci for more debauchery. Zøg feeling
that he does not give Bean enough to do, decides to make her an ambassador
while the family goes on their trip to Dankmire, the homeland of Oona and her
son Derek. When they get there, the group puts up with the customs of the
Dankmirians who for years were at war with the Dreamlanders due to a canal
that was built (which the Dankmirians were forced to pay for). Both sides
claimed ownership of the canal and the fighting stopped once Zøg married Oona.
Impressed with Bean handling the situation, Zøg asks for her to give a speech
at a banquet. Overcome with the stress of thinking of what to say, Luci spikes
Bean's drink and she shows up drunk at the banquet where she humiliates
herself and her family and offends the Dankmirians who chase them out of their
land. Oona makes it back safely, but Zøg and Derek are captured by hillbillies
and Bean, Elfo, and Luci rescue them. Zøg finally admits that he is proud of
Bean and allows her to go to Hay Man, an event that he initially disallowed

blood to bring people back to life. However, the pendant still does not work.
An expert is brought in and reveals that Elfo is not a true elf, angering Zøg
who kicks him out of Dreamland. Odval allows Bean and Luci to go and find Elfo
so that he and the knights can follow. Bean and Luci find Elfo who decides to

and Dagmar arrive at Maru where the Enchantress (Becky) and Cloyd are. They

Trogs to throw Dagmar out, although she escapes, and the others leave the
caves. Meanwhile on the surface, a walrus has been placed as a decoy for Zøg,
and Derek decides to make up his own decrees against the wishes of Odval and
the archdruidess. While hiding in his room, Derek finds a book with a secret
history of the kings of Dreamland, but with the last few pages torn out, and
is found by Odval. Later that night, Odval and the archdruidess observe Bean
and company climbing out of the caves.

Beanie Get Your Gun

:: Date
2021-01-15

:: Description
Derek welcomes Bean and Zøg back into Dreamland. He pardons Bean, and
relinquishes the crown back to Zøg. Zøg’s erratic behavior raises some
concern, and Bean tries to investigate its cause. Meanwhile, Derek gets locked
out of the castle and tries to make some friends. He ends up being taken
advantage of due to his gullibility, until he meets fairy Sagatha. Sagatha and
her fairy friends teach Derek some wisdom and street smarts, after which Derek
proposes to Sagatha. Bean finds Pendergast’s headless body in his own locker.
There was a gunshot through his armor, which prompted Bean to reach into the
armour, subsequently pulling out a bullet. Bean searches the castle for the
gun, with the help of the crystal ball and Ms. Moonpence. She hides the gun in
her room after locating it in Odval’s globe. Derek returns to Dreamland, and a
wedding is held for him and Sagatha after receiving Zøg’s blessing. During the
ceremony, a sharp-eyed Derek notices the gun hidden in the Arch Druidess’
sleeve, and halts the wedding. The Arch Druidess escapes on a motorcycle, but
she dropped a roadmap to Steamland.

:: Description
Bean and Elfo go after the Arch Druidess, while Luci stays with Zøg (who is
having a mental breakdown) in Dreamland. When they arrive in Steamland Bean
infiltrates the Gunderson factory to find the Arch Druidess, and Elfo is taken
into a upscale explorers club impressing everybody about his past tales when a
strange man notices a pin on the clothing he stole. At the factory Bean meets
a man named Gordy while working there. In the end she realizes that Gordy is
actually Alva Gunderson the founder of the company, and he wants to make a
deal because of some sort of magic that is powerful and in Dreamland. He is
the one who sent his brother Skybert to Dreamland in part two, and hired the
Arch Druidess to lure Bean to Steamland, though he denies any knowledge of the
Arch Druidess' acts of murder and has her taken away, but not before she warns
Bean not to trust Alva. At the prestigious club, the other patrons are
impressed by Elfo, until a man who owns a freak show comes in and takes Elfo
for his collection.

Elfo and Bean are about to escape, but Elfo reminds Bean of one lasting member
of the freak show: Mora. They rescue her from her tank and barely escape on a
steamboat, with the help of Mora. Along the way, Elfo begins a strange
relationship with the steamboat, while Bean opens up about her feelings for
other people with Mora, the mermaid, as they grow closer to one another. They
crash land on Mermaid Island, where Mora introduces Bean to her family, and
they have a romantic night together. The following day, Bean wakes up and
since she does not find Mora's necklace around her neck, believes that
everything that happened the day before was a dream, and walks across the

on shore, confirming that the experience with Mora was real.

Bad Moon Rising

:: Date
2021-01-15

:: Description
Bean returns to Dreamland, distraught over her time with Mora, still believing
it was a hallucination, but looking back at it lovingly. Oona, who has
returned to Dreamland to attend Derek's wedding-gone-wrong, comforts her and
secretly believes her that the mermaid encounter was real. She later overhears
Odval and the other members of the royal council plotting against Zøg, as they
did with his brother Yøg, so she tells Oona of her recent discoveries (who is
devastated as Yøg was the love of her life)  and the two team up in an effort
to undermine their scheme, while telling Luci and Elfo to raise an army to
protect the kingdom. Luci and Elfo trains the nearly incompetent townsfolk to
become well-trained soldiers, but the army is dispersed after seeing Elfo
perform a ritual with Trixy and the trogs on the full moon, in which they
spank the bare butts at it. Oona and Bean's plan backfires and they are
revealed as who they really are, and when Zøg comes down to the basement, he
sees them naked and spying on Odval and further descends into a downward
spiral, which was the council's plan all along.

The Madness of King Zøg

:: Date
2021-01-15

:: Description
Zøg is locked up in the castle's insane asylum, and begins to speak gibberish.
Bean convinces Odval to let her speak to her father, and she is able to get
through to him, but later, after a visit from the ghost of Dagmar, he escapes
and wanders about the city, confused. Bean follows after him, and eventually
finds him wandering into a shop, where he purchases a ventriloquist dummy. He
begins speaking in riddles and insults through the dummy, and only Bean can
truly understand what he is saying. When a cloud of green smoke can be seen
clearing a nearby mountain range, the kingdom begins to worry. Bean speaks to
Zøg for advice and he prepares her for the coming attack. However, Zøg's
condition still seems to be worsening. Elfo admits that he thinks that Bean is
just imagining that what the dummy is saying are actually clues, and that Bean
is running the kingdom by herself. After speaking to Zøg one last time, Bean
realizes that even he knows about how bad his insanity has gotten, and he
requests to be sent away so he can get better. Bean sends him to an unknown
location with Chazzzzz.

Bean Falls Down

:: Date
2021-01-15

:: Description
Princess Bean is crowned queen after Zøg is deemed unfit to be king and is
taken away for treatment with Chazzzzz. The mysterious green smoke reaches the
castle, and turns out to be Big Jo and his lesser-known assistant, Porky, who
want to make amends for what they did to Bean, Elfo, and Luci. Bean is
untrusting of the exorcist, even though he claims to have changed, and locks
him in a dungeon, much to the annoyance of Odval, who wanted to work with Big
Jo. Soon after, ogres arrive wanting Elfo, who blinded their prince, but
against the wishes of everyone else, she doesn't let them have Elfo and
instead fends them off by dumping all the alcohol in the kingdom onto them.
Bean, Elfo, and Luci realize that the entire horde of ogres are too much for
them to handle alone and hide in the secret library. Elfo, realizing that the
ogres will soon come and kill him (and the rest of the kingdom and Bean, as
well), sacrifices himself—much to Bean's horror—to the ogres, who take him
away instead of killing him. Dagmar arrives in a secret elevator that connects
to the secret library, Luci tries to save her but is decapitated by the
elevator doors and dies. Dagmar takes Bean to Hell to marry a mysterious man
who resembles Alva. Luci wakes up to find himself in Heaven with Jerry and
God, much to his dismay.
