Cole catches fireflies at his grandparent’s Russ and Klara’s yard. The next
day, Russ takes Cole to an old Loop project, a huge rusting “echo sphere.”
Russ informs Cole, George, and Klara that his doctor has predicted he does not
have long to live. At the Loop, Russ tells Loretta that he is putting her in
charge of the Loop and she accepts. Russ takes Cole on a drive for one last
teachable moment. Russ arrives home and makes a foreshadowing comment to
Klara. He goes to the bedroom and collapses. Jakob informs Cole that their
grandfather is in the hospital. Determined that the Loop can save Russ, Cole
breaks into the underground complex, but gets caught by Loretta as he’s about
to touch the mysterious sphere at the heart of the Loop. After initially
hesitating, George takes Cole to see Russ in the hospital. Russ is delusional,
which shocks Cole. Later at the hospital, Russ, in his final moments, dreams
of merging with the underground sphere. Cole returns to the echo sphere alone.
He shouts into it again, and with each echo, he envisions the decades of his
life passing by. Finally, he sees the sphere filled with fireflies.
