the need to prove one's self [The teenager David wanted above all else to prove to everyone that he was a man, and saw owning a gun as a path to achieving this end.]
teenage rebellion [David was a stereopytical rebellious teen.]
personally irresponsible character [David avoided taking responsibility for his actions at every turn. Most notably, he lied about having accidentally shot dead Mr. Hawkins' mule, and then he ran away from home rather than face the consequences of his action.]
lying [David lied to his mother repeatedly. He also lied to the other workers about not focusing on his work and to Mr. Hawkings and his father about the quality of his work.

:: Major Themes
life in the American Wild West [The viewer is presented with a view of what it might have been like to stay at a small town hotel located on the American frontier circa 1898. In his monologue, Henry Fonda spelled out that the Swede got into trouble at the hotel on account of having let his fanciful, "dime-novel" inspired characterizations of the Wild West get the better of him.]
overactive imagination [The Swede's fanciful, "dime-novel" inspired characterization of the Wild West quickly got him into trouble during his stay at the Fort Romper hotel.]
xenophobia in society [The Swede had both fearful and derogatory misconceptions about the denizens of Fort Romper and those living in the Wild West in general, calling them "dangerous bastards" who would gang up on him and kill him. Bill and Johnnie derided the Swede for being an immigrant. Bill showed his contempt for foreigners by calling the Swede a Dutchman even after being corrected.]
self-fulfilling prophesy [Because of his overactive imagination, the Swede was convinced that he would be murdered in the hotel, and sure enough he ended up being killed by a fellow guest whom he'd provoked.]
the hospitality industry [Mr. Scully was a small hotel owner and the story portrayed him at work. Mr. Scully did his utmost to be a paragon of hospitality so that his guests would be comfortable. He carried their bags from the station, helped them wash up, made sure they had a good dinner, and gave the Swede his prized gin from India to drink to calm his nerves.

coping with the death of a child [Mr. Scully kept a photo on display of his dearly departed young daughter.]
crime and punishment [The way the guest who stabbed the Swede reacted after the fact revealed how the zeitgeist of the Wild West had changed in terms of the transition from lawlessness to the rule of law. In particular, whether the guest should be charged with manslaughter according to the new laws of the land or he should be judged according to the old ways of the Wild West was left up in the air.]
self-justification [A hotel guest used that the Swede had acted aggressively toward others as a justification for having killed him.]
human vs. human [Johnnie and the Swede to duked it out in the snow, with the hotel patrons and staff standing in watch, to settle their quarrel.]

Edward and Mary Richards lamented the fact that they had done as the stranger instructed and put out an ad about the gold.

what if I suddenly got some free money [Robert J. Titmarsh was interviewed by a journalist and said that if he got the gold he would pay off his mortgage. His wife said she would rather spend the money on clothes. Another citizen said he would use the money to move out west to California. Another man said he would donate all of the money to charitable causes.]
humility [Before realizing they'd been hoodwinked, several of Hadleyburg's most upstanding citizens rehearsed self-effacing acceptance speeches.]

resentment [The war veteran become sharecropper Ab Scopes was a powder keg of pent up resentments stemming from something to do with him and his family being destitute while a privileged few lived in splendor. Ab intentionally wiped his dirty boots on the Mrs. DeSpain's expensive French rug, then glared silently at her when she protested before turning and striding out the door.]

father and son [The story explores the troubled relationship between the young and perhaps naive Satry and his jaded father, Ab. Sarty was very pleased when his father gave him a pocketknife.]
choosing between conflicting loyalties [When Sarty was asked about Ab's whereabouts when a barn had caught fire, Sarty said nothing. In general, Sarty was torn between being loyal to his arsonist father and obedient to the laws of the land. In the end, Sarty betrayed his father by running to alert the DeSpains that their barn was on fire.]
loyalty to one's family [The patriarch Ab Scopes expounded on the importance family loyalty, and his son Sarty struggled with it on account that Ab was a serial barn burner. Ab took him for a walk and explained his view that blood was more important than anything, berating and slapping him for his hesitance in supporting his father's firebug tendencies.]

husband and wife [Ab Scopes's wife pleaded with him to refrain from burning down yet another wealthy landlord's barn, but to no avail.]

poisonous to others.

:: Major Themes
father and daughter [Rappaccini was very protective of Beatrice to the point of confining her to his private garden and controlling her interactions with people from the outside world. For instance, noticing Giovanni was gazing at Beatrice, Rappaccini quickly escorted her inside.]
stereotypically innocent character [Sequestered to her father's estate her whole life, Beatrice knew little of the outside world and was even likened to pre-fall Eve by her father.]
tragic love [Giovanni was smitten with the garden-bound, poison maiden Beatrice. But their love was not to be, as Beatrice died tragically in the end.]
deadly touch ability [A lifetime of tending poisonous plants left Beatrice poisonous to most living things she touched. In one scene, a butterfly that landed on Beatrice's hand instantly died. It later became apparent that Giovanni acquired the same poison touch when a bouquet of flowers he was given wilted in his hands.]
suicide [The story culminated with Beatrice imbibing the "antidote" knowing that it would end her life, perhaps because she refused to be controlled by either her father nor Giovanni, although this is interpretive.]
human life choice [In the end, Beatrice chose to take her own life over living indefinitely as a prisoner in her father's garden with a man who blamed her for his own troubles.]
loneliness [Due to her being rendered deadly by her father's scientific experiments, Beatrice was condemned to lead a lonely existence on her father's estate. Giovanni wrote in a letter that he was heartsick, that he was in a new place but that his heart remained in Naples.]
coping with someone controlling your life [Beatrice was under the dominion of her father, Rappaccini.]
obsession [Rappacini's preoccupation with his botanical research blinded him to the fact that he'd ruined his daughter's life in the process. To wit Baglioni said that Rappacini "cares more for science than for mankind".]
the thirst for knowledge [Rappacini ruthlessly used his daughter as an instrument to advance his botanical research with no regard for her well-being.]
infatuation [Giovanni found himself under the spell of Beatrice or a spell her father cast or a spell Giovanni put himself under.]
female independence [In the end, Beatrice lamented that both her father and Giovanni seemed bent on denying her autonomy.]
playing God with nature [In one interpretation of the story, Rappacini made a poison maiden out of his daughter Beatrice with a view toward making her a new Eve. Rumors of unspecified "unnatural experiments" surrounded Rappacini, according to his former colleague Baglioni.]
disapproving parent [Rappacini did not approve of his daughter having suitors whatsoever. One must think he relished the thought of them dying if they tried to kiss her.]
wicked character vs. virtuous character [Rapacini's wickedness in creating someone whose touch was deadly was compared and contrasted with his daughter's general virtuousness by contemporary standards. (By today's standards she was just not much of a moral agent at all).]

:: Minor Themes
gambling [Distracted by thoughts of his crush Beatrice, Giovanni lost a hand of some unspecified card game, played with conspicuously oversized playing cards, to a fellow student when really Giovanni had the best hand at the table.]
humans interacting [Giovanni enjoyed the mirth of a local tavern upon his arrival.]
mistrust [The townspeople expressed trepidation about the garden and its owner, Rappaccini. When Giovanni asked whether the garden was the owner's of the hotel, Emma responded "Heaven forbid".]

:: Other Keywords
personification [Beatrice calls a deadly plant her sister and promised to take care of her.]
literary allusion [Giovanni contemplated the fact that he could be staying in the same room as Dante did.]
