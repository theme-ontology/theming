:: Major Themes
the need to prove one's self [The teenager David wanted above all else to prove to everyone that he was a man, and saw owning a gun as a path to achieving this end.]
teenage rebellion [David was a stereopytical rebellious teen.]
personally irresponsible character [David avoided taking responsibility for his actions at every turn. Most notably, he lied about having accidentally shot dead Mr. Hawkins' mule, and then he ran away from home rather than face the consequences of his action.]
lying [David lied to his mother repeatedly. He also lied to the other workers about not focusing on his work and to Mr. Hawkings and his father about the quality of his work. Most notably, David lied to everyone about accidentally shooting and killing Jenny the mule. Joe lied to David about the quality of the pistol he sold him.]

running away from home [The story concludes with David hopping on a freight train on its way out of town.]
racism in society [Mr. Hawkings and Joe casually addressed the African-American teenager David as "boy" on multiple occasions. Mr. Hawkings' (a white man) questioning David's (an African-American youth) work and work ethic may have had racist undertones as it is a story set in the American Deep South in the early 20th century.]
family dispute [Mr. and Mrs. Saunders squabbled before dinner.]
