:: Major Themes
the need to prove one's self [The teenager David wanted above all else to prove to everyone that he was a man, and saw owning a gun as a path to achieving this end.]
teenage rebellion [David was a stereopytical rebellious teen.]
personally irresponsible character [David avoided taking responsibility for his actions at every turn. Most notably, he lied about having accidentally shot dead Mr. Hawkins' mule, and then he ran away from home rather than face the consequences of his action.]
lying [David lied to his mother repeatedly. He also lied to the other workers about not focusing on his work and to Mr. Hawkings and his father about the quality of his work. Most notably, David lied to everyone about accidentally shooting and killing Jenny the mule. Joe lied to David about the quality of the pistol he sold him.]

running away from home [The story concludes with David hopping on a freight train on its way out of town.]
racism in society [Mr. Hawkings and Joe casually addressed the African-American teenager David as "boy" on multiple occasions.

life in the American Wild West [The viewer is presented with a view of what it might have been like to stay at a small town hotel located on the American frontier circa 1898. In his monologue, Henry Fonda spelled out that the Swede got into trouble at the hotel on account of having let his fanciful, "dime-novel" inspired characterizations of the Wild West get the better of him.]
overactive imagination [The Swede's fanciful, "dime-novel" inspired characterization of the Wild West quickly got him into trouble during his stay at the Fort Romper hotel.]
xenophobia in society [The Swede had both fearful and derogatory misconceptions about the denizens of Fort Romper and those living in the Wild West in general, calling them "dangerous bastards" who would gang up on him and kill him. Bill and Johnnie derided the Swede for being an immigrant. Bill showed his contempt for foreigners by calling the Swede a Dutchman even after being corrected.]
self-fulfilling prophesy [Because of his overactive imagination, the Swede was convinced that he would be murdered in the hotel, and sure enough he ended up being killed by a fellow guest whom he'd provoked.]
the hospitality industry [Mr. Scully was a small hotel owner and the story portrayed him at work. Mr. Scully did his utmost to be a paragon of hospitality so that his guests would be comfortable. He carried their bags from the station, helped them wash up, made sure they had a good dinner, and gave the Swede his prized gin from India to drink to calm his nerves.

coping with the death of a child [Mr. Scully kept a photo on display of his dearly departed young daughter.]
crime and punishment [The way the guest who stabbed the Swede reacted after the fact revealed how the zeitgeist of the Wild West had changed in terms of the transition from lawlessness to the rule of law. In particular, whether the guest should be charged with manslaughter according to the new laws of the land or he should be judged according to the old ways of the Wild West was left up in the air.]
self-justification [A hotel guest used that the Swede had acted aggressively toward others as a justification for having killed him.]
human vs. human [Johnnie and the Swede to duked it out in the snow, with the hotel patrons and staff standing in watch, to settle their quarrel.]

Harold was steadfast in his assertions that he hadn't been scared, leading to Bill Kenner to tell him to stay away from him.]
Christianity [Mrs. Krebs praised the Lord for having brought her son home from the war safe and sound. It is clear from the small town American context that this was the Christian God.]
coping with a crisis of faith [While Harold's mother seems distressed that Harold cannot pray aloud with her, Harold seems very matter-of-fact about his unbelief.]
