Foster attempts to delay her again. Sat in the car and just about to leave, he

the house to get it. Mrs. Foster then notices the gift stuck in the car.
Frantic to get to the airport on time, she runs after him to tell him she's
found the gift, and sees that he has taken their in-house elevator to go
upstairs. She hears him shouting her name and realises her husband is stuck in
the lift. A slight smile twitches across her face. She returns to the car and
