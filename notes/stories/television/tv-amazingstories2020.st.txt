:: Choice Themes

children and candy from strangers [Elijah accepted a Whiz bar from Lt. Cole, but only after pointing out that it was inappropriate for a stranger to offer candy to children.]
superstitiousness [Lt. Cole explained this past action of his as a "dumb superstition": He intentionally avoided saying goodbye to his lover before going off to fight in the war because he felt that way he was "never really gone".]
