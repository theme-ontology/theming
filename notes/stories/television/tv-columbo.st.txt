:: Choice Themes
how to murder someone and get away with it [Psychiatrist Dr. Ray Flemming murdered his wife with the help of his mistress and made it look as if the victim had been strangled by a burglar. He would have gotten away with her crime had it not been for the meddlesome Lt. Columbo.]
spouse murder [Psychiatrist Dr. Ray Flemming murdered his wife with the help of his mistress and made it look as if the victim had been strangled by a burglar. He would have gotten away with her crime had it not been for the meddlesome Lt. Columbo.]

:: Major Themes
medical occupation [The villain of the story Dr. Ray Flemming was a psychiatrist. He was shown practicing his craft at his clinic. He indulged Columbo by psychoanalyzing a hypothetical murderer, i.e., himself.] 
husband and wife [Ray and Carol Flemming. The story turns on Ray strangling Carol to death so that he could be together with his mistress, Joan, without going through a scandal mired and financially ruinous divorce. The story opens with Ray and Carol celebrating their 10th wedding anniversary at home in the company of many friends. Columbo shared some anecdotes about his own wife: she considers him to be forgetful, the pair were thinking of taking a vacation, and she'd prefer he smoke a pipe over those smelly cigars.]
extramarital affair [The story turns on Ray offing his wife ostensibly to be with his young, ginger haired mistress, Joan.]
man and mistress [The story turns on Ray offing his wife ostensibly to be with his young, ginger haired mistress, Joan.]
romantic love [The story turns on Ray offing his wife ostensibly to be with his young, ginger haired mistress, Joan.]
law enforcement [It was up to the sharp-witted, but shabbily dressed homicide detective Lt. Columbo to prove that the psychiatrist Dr. Ray Flemming had strangled his wife in cold blood and made it look like she was killed by a burglar.]
appearances can be deceiving [Witnesses and villains alike are caught off guard by Lieutenant Columbo's bumbling façade, which invariably proves to conceal a laser-focused mind. Ray psychoanalyzed Columbo thusly: "You never stop do you? The insinuation, the change of pace. You're a bag of tricks, Columbo, right down to that prop cigar you use. I'm going to tell you something about yourself: You say you need a psychiatrist; maybe you do and maybe you don't. But you are the textbook example of compensation... adaptability. You're an intelligent man, Columbo, but you hide it. You pretend you're something you are not. Why? Because of your appearance. You think you cannot get by on looks or polish, so you turn a defect into a virtue. You take people by surprise. They underestimate you, and that's where you trip them up. Like coming here tonight."]
pride goes before a fall [A recurring motif was Dr. Flemming's self-assured conviction that, thanks to his immense intellect, there was no conceivable way a mere police investigator could find him out. Lt. Columbo later pointed out that while Dr. Flemming might indeed outgun him in the brainpower department, Lt. Columbo's lengthy experience with murders counted for a lot more.]

:: Minor Themes
divorce [Carol informed Ray she'd be calling her lawyers in morning about filing for divorce when he came home after stepping out from their wedding anniversary party to see his mistress. She changed her mind after falling for Ray's lies.]
gold digging [Carol and Ray half-joked that he married her for her father's money.]
the inclination to believe what one wants to believe [A disguised Joan doubted that she would pass for Ray's wife, Carol. Ray, however, assuaged her anxiety by citing the so-called "Principle of Association", which he summed up as something to the effect of "people see what they expect to see, and not what is really there".]
burglary [Ray staged a burglary of his own home as part of a calculated plot to off his wife.]
beating one's self up [Ray theatrically feigned to blame himself for his wife's plight.]
funeral rite [A funeral was held for Carol.]
acting [Joan spoke of her acting career. She was costumed as an Ancient Greco-Roman woman at the studio.]
suicide [Columbo staged Joan's suicide.]
coping with a loved one being in peril [Dr. Flemming feigned distress after he got the news that his wife was in a coma-like state following a murder attempt.]
romantic jealousy [Carol became jealous when she thought, correctly as it were, that Ray had been seeing his mistress again.]
humans interacting [Ray and Carol Flemming celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary in the company of friends at home.]

Murder by the Book

:: Date
1971-09-15

:: Description
Ken Franklin is one-half of a mystery writing team, but partner Jim Ferris
wants to go solo, exposing the fact that Ferris did all the actual writing,
and thus leave the high-living Franklin without his cash cow. However, the
pair have an insurance policy on which Franklin can collect if Ferris dies
during the partnership. Franklin makes it look like Ferris was investigating
gangsters. He tricks Ferris into taking a trip to Franklin's remote cabin two
hours away. They stop at a general store, where, as Franklin makes a phone
call to Ferris's wife to establish an alibi, the owner Lilly La
Sanka—obviously smitten with Franklin—peers outside to see whom Franklin
brought with him and sees Ferris in the passenger seat of the car. At the
cabin, Franklin convinces Ferris to call his wife and tell her he's working
late at the office. During the phone call, Franklin shoots Ferris. He drives
two hours back to his house with his dead partner in the trunk, dumping the
corpse on his own lawn. La Sanka tracks Franklin to Los Angeles when he is out
on a date and loudly approaches him, making it clear that she knows Franklin
killed Ferris, forcing him to cancel his date. He brings her the $15,000 she
wants for her silence, feigning interest in her. The two have an intimate
dinner in the back of her store, then he bludgeons her and puts her body in a
boat, which he capsizes to make her death appear accidental.

Final clue/twist: After hearing that Ferris habitually wrote down ideas for
his mystery novels on whatever paper was handy, Columbo searches his office
and house and finds a note with the fake phone call/alibi scheme. He confronts
Franklin with it, and Franklin confesses. Upon his arrest, Franklin makes a
startling comment: the alibi idea was in fact his, the only good one he ever
had. Note: In 1997 TV Guide ranked this episode number 16 on its '100 Greatest
Episodes of All Time' list.

The Mrs. Melville novel that is frequently seen in the episode is named
"Prescription: Murder", the same name as Columbo's first pilot episode.

attitude of superiority [Ken Franklin patronizing explained to Columbo how he should go about solving the murder mystery. He later spoke arrogantly about his luxurious lifestyle.]

Death Lends a Hand

:: Date
1971-10-06

:: Description
Carl Brimmer, the very tough, hard-nosed head of a private detective agency,
with unfortunate and fateful anger issues, is hired by Arthur Kennicut, a
powerful publishing magnate who suspects his wife, Lenore, of infidelity.
Although Brimmer indeed finds evidence of her being unfaithful, instead of
reporting this fact to his client, he attempts to blackmail Lenore into
obtaining business and political secrets from her husband. She refuses and
tells him she will expose his plot to her husband, at which point Brimmer
accidentally kills her in a fit of rage. He dumps her body at a scrapyard and
later joins the investigation into Lenore's death with Columbo. Brimmer
secretly starts to divert suspicion away from himself and even offers Columbo
a job.

Final clue/twist: Columbo becomes suspicious when he realizes a cut on the
victim's face matches Brimmer's ring. He disables Brimmer's car, causing the
vehicle to be garaged for repair. He has Lenore's body exhumed, then claims
that one of her contact lenses was not with the body and is missing. He tells
Brimmer the lens must be either at the crime scene or in the car the murderer
used to transport the body. After searching for it in his home, Brimmer goes
to the garage after-hours and searches for it in the trunk of his car. He
finds a contact lens, but is caught by Columbo, with Kennicut in tow. When
Brimmer tries to throw the lens away the police stop him, and he confesses.
After Brimmer is led away Columbo admits to Kennicut he had arranged
everything, and that there never was a missing contact lens. Notes: This
episode won an Emmy for writing and is known for the "glasses effect" after
Brimmer kills Lenore, in which both lenses of Brimmer's glasses simultaneously
show different images on-screen of him cleaning the scene of the crime.

Brimmer is the first of a small number of Columbo killers who appear
sympathetic after Columbo catches them as Brimmer apologetically tells
Kennicut that the killing was an accident and that he didn't want to hurt
either one of them.

Major General Martin Hollister, a retired Marine Corps war hero, learns he is
being investigated for embezzling military funds, then shoots his skittish
accomplice, Col. Dutton. The act is partially witnessed by Helen Stewart, who
was in a passing boat. She is wooed by Hollister into doubting her own story.

Final clue/twist: After an encounter with his nostalgia-crazy cook, Columbo
realizes that Hollister would never have let go of his signature revolver, the
assumed murder weapon. Columbo retrieves the weapon, which Hollister claimed
was a replica made for his museum display, and the police forensic unit
identifies it as the weapon that killed Dutton. Hollister, with his
extraordinary self-confidence, had assumed that everyone would accept what he
said about the exhibit's weapon being merely a replica.

Art critic Dale Kingston murders his uncle and tries to frame his aunt to
inherit his uncle's very valuable art collection. He later murders his lover
and accomplice in the crime, the gullible art student, Tracy.

Final clue/twist: Kingston hides the paintings that he stole after the murder
in his aunt's house to frame her, then arranges for the police to find them.
Columbo, arriving late on the scene, accuses Kingston of the murder and says
he can prove it with fingerprints. Kingston replies that his fingerprints
being all over the paintings prove nothing. Columbo retorts that it is his own
fingerprints that prove the case, from when he touched the paintings early in
the investigation, when he visited Kingston in his home. Shaken, Kingston
insists that Columbo must have touched the paintings moments ago, to frame
him. Columbo takes his hands out of his pockets to show that he has been
wearing gloves the whole time.

Lady in Waiting

1971-12-15

:: Description
Beth Chadwick murders her domineering older brother, Bryce, after he attempts
to break up her relationship with one of his executives, Peter Hamilton, a man
he thinks is only interested in Beth for ulterior motives. His mailing a
letter threatening to terminate Peter's employment if he didn't break things
off with Beth causes her to reach the tipping point and to act to gain control
of her own life and, it turns out, the family business (as there are no other
siblings). Complications in Beth's plan contribute to Columbo's suspicions.
Beth had planned to claim the shooting was an accident. She removed his house
key from his key chain thinking it would require him, late at night, to try to
enter the house via her bedroom. However, Bryce had a spare key which he had
hidden under a flowerpot thus entering the house without ado. She improvises
as best she can but her story will ultimately be undermined as a result of
this turn of events. Meanwhile, her true personality emerges, showing a very
different side than that shown earlier, before the murder.

Final clue/twist: When Columbo re-reads the testimony of Peter Hamilton, who
had driven to the house after receiving the letter from Bryce, he notices that
Hamilton climbed over the gates and heard the gunshots before the alarm went
off, not after. The detail is enough to undo her entire story. Columbo tells
Beth that Hamilton won't like doing it, but he will testify to what he knows.

Then she'd shoot him and pretend that she'd done so in a delirium after just waking up and mistaking him for a burglar.

him believe the fateful accident was a result of treacherous driving
conditions rather than Roger's bomb. Columbo shows Roger a damaged but intact
box of cigars and tells him it came from the death scene. Along with Everett,
they take a cable car up the mountain. Roger, thinking they are the booby-
trapped cigars he had planted, becomes unhinged. He screams at Columbo to get
rid of the box because it is about to explode. Columbo reveals that the box is
not from the death scene, that he had just got it and scuffed it up to look
like it had been. Realizing he has been tricked, Roger can only laugh
hysterically.

Blueprint for Murder

:: Date
1972-02-09

:: Description
Elliot Markham is an architect with a vision for a city of the future, and a
penchant for classical music. His latest project is being bankrolled by the
young wife of Bo Williamson, a wealthy industrialist who has been away on a
lengthy overseas business trip. When Williamson returns and finds out how his
money is being spent, he is furious, and intends to cut off the funds. Markham
decides that the only way he can continue his work is to eliminate Williamson.
Simply killing him, however, poses a problem, because his money reverts to a
trust fund when he dies. Markham comes up with a clever plan to conceal the
body and make it appear as if Beau has gone on another long foreign trip.

Final clue/twist: Markham repeatedly goads Columbo into excavating a building
site to search for Williamson's body, until Columbo finally does so. It yields
nothing. Later that night Markham returns to that site with the body, assuming
no-one would ever look there again. However Columbo has known what Markham has
been up to all along, he emerges from the shadows with other policemen and
arrests Markham. Columbo reveals that he knew something had happened to
Williamson when he checked his car and found the radio turned to a classical
music station, something odd for Williamson, who only listened to country
music.

Alex Benedict, the married conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra
who resembles the famous conductor Leonard Bernstein, murders his mistress,
Jennifer Welles, after she insists on going public with their affair, and
tries to make it look like a suicide. Columbo searches for clues to place
Benedict at the murder scene.

Final clue/twist: During the murder, Benedict loses his signature boutonnière.
While conducting that night's concert he realizes its loss and goes back to
the now police-crowded crime scene. He recovers the flower and puts it back
on. A TV news team records him leaving the house with it, while the recording
of the earlier concert shows him being without it. Columbo insists this proves
that Benedict must have been there the night of the murder. Witnessing their

highly unlikely the District Attorney would take the case to trial with such

The Greenhouse Jungle

:: Date
1972-10-15

:: Description
Jarvis Goodland and his nephew, Tony, stage Tony's kidnapping in order to
break into his trust fund and use his half to hold on to his wife, to whom he
wishes to remain married, despite her expensive tastes and separate social and
romantic life. Jarvis, disgusted at the notion, shoots and kills Tony, whom he
has always despised, once the ransom is paid, and a careful swapping of guns
with Tony's wife casts suspicion in her direction.

Final clue/twist: After Columbo remembers that Jarvis Goodland had years
earlier fired a gun at a burglar but only managed to hit a flowerpot, Columbo
searches the greenhouse with a metal detector for the old slug. It turns out
to be identical to the bullet with which Tony was murdered, proving Goodland
killed his nephew, and that the gun evidence against Tony's wife was part of a
frame-up.

This episode marks the first appearance of Bob Dishy as Columbo's newly
assigned and totally unwanted neophyte partner, Sergeant Frederick Wilson,
full of the latest techniques from Berkeley. He appears again in Now You See
Him... (Season 5, Episode 5). It is also the first episode in which the main
crime is committed after Columbo's initial appearance.

The Most Crucial Game

:: Date
1972-11-05

:: Description
Paul Hanlon, the general manager of the Los Angeles Rockets football team,
wants to create a sports empire, but Eric Wagner, who inherited the team,
lacks ambition. Hanlon sneaks out of the stadium during the national anthem by
disguising himself as an ice cream truck driver. He drives to a pay phone near
Wagner's home, knowing Wagner's phones have been bugged, during which Hanlon
makes it appear he's in his private box at the stadium by holding a radio to
the receiver. He then drives to Wagner's house, bludgeons him with a blow to
the head with a heavy piece of ice, which melts in the swimming pool, to make
it appear to be an accident. Complicating matters is Eve Babcock, ostensibly a
secretary but actually a call girl and an operative placed in Eric's home by a
private detective who was, in turn, hired by Eric's attorney, Walter Cannell.
James Gregory plays the football team’s coach.

Final clue/twist: Columbo notices that the tape of the phone call Hanlon made
to establish his alibi, which Hanlon insists was made from his private box in
the stadium, did not capture the sound made whenever Hanlon’s office clock
chimes to signal the bottom of the hour (the half hour). It proves that
Hanlon’s phone call was not made from his private box.

Dagger of the Mind

:: Description
When Sir Roger Haversham realizes that actors Nicholas Frame and his wife,
Lillian Stanhope, have manipulated him into backing their theater production,
he confronts the couple, and is accidentally killed during the ensuing
scuffle. The pair cover up the killing by stuffing the body into a trunk,
taking it home to his estate, and staging an apparent fall down the stairs.
Columbo is visiting London to study British police techniques as the guest of
Scotland Yard Detective Chief Superintendent William Durk, who is called to
investigate the incident. Miss Dudley, an attractive young understudy Frame
has his eye on, is intensely disliked by Stanhope. Haversham's butler covers
for the couple but later tries to blackmail them and is murdered by Frame.
The theater doorman comes into possession of the dead man's umbrella, which
becomes vital to the resolution of the case.

Final clue/twist: Columbo engineers a situation whereby, before witnesses,
they search the dead man’s closed umbrella, on exhibit in a wax museum, for a
pearl from Lillian Stanhope's broken necklace. According to Columbo this could
only have gotten there during the killing. When the umbrella is opened and a
pearl is revealed, the increasingly unstable Frame starts babbling, and
Stanhope, now overwhelmed, confesses to how they killed Sir Roger. (Columbo
had, however, used his childhood marble-playing skills to shoot the pearl into
the umbrella moments before it was opened.)

The first of several episodes to feature locations outside the United States,
it was filmed in both London and Hollywood. Although scenes with Wilfrid Hyde-
White were set in London, due to the actor's tax problems all his character's
scenes were filmed in California.

Requiem for a Falling Star

:: Date
1973-01-21

:: Description
Jean Davis, personal assistant to aging movie star Nora Chandler, is engaged
to gossip reporter Jerry Parks, and she has secret information about Chandler.
Nora deflates the tire of Jean's car so that the engaged couple will have to
switch vehicles. Chandler starts a gasoline fire just as Parks's car (being
driven by Davis) pulls into his garage. It initially appears that the
murderer's intended victim was Parks, but actually Jean was the target.
Columbo solves the case after connecting it to the mysterious disappearance of
Chandler's husband a decade earlier.

Final clue/twist: Columbo is not sure of anything. He watches one of Nora's
old movies in which she disguised herself as a man to commit a murder. He
remembers some facts about the disappearance of her husband years before, that
the fountain in Nora's garden does not work, and learns it was purchased the
day after her husband disappeared. He tricks Nora into thinking her husband's
body might have been discovered. When she rushes home and runs straight to her
garden, Columbo, lying in wait, confronts her. She confesses that she killed
her husband and buried his body under the fountain, and that Jean knew it and
that is why she killed her.

A Stitch in Crime

:: Description
Cardiac surgeon Dr. Barry Mayfield and Dr. Edmund Hiedemann have pioneered a
major medical breakthrough that Mayfield wants to publish about immediately,
but Hiedemann wants to wait and do more tests. When Dr. Hiedemann's heart
condition worsens, requiring the insertion of a heart valve, Mayfield performs
the surgery using non-permanent sutures, that will kill his partner when it
dissolves in his body. Nurse Sharon Martin, a friend of Hiedemann, who has
never trusted or liked Mayfield, uncovers a suspicious piece of suture, which
she takes with her from the operating room. Mayfield observes her doing this
and later kills Martin in the hospital garage parking area, staging it as an
apparent mugging. He later tries to pin the crime on her ex-boyfriend, a
former drug addict, whom he kills as well. This episode contains one of the
rare occasions when Columbo loses (or appears to lose) his temper; suddenly
slamming a coffee pot down onto Mayfield's desk he angrily warns him that if
Hiedemann dies, the police will have his body autopsied to check what sutures
were used in his operation.

Final clue/twist: Mayfield operates on Heidemann again, ostensibly for medical
reasons but actually to replace the dissolving sutures. As soon as the
procedure is completed, police swarm the operating suite and search for the
removed sutures. Mayfield loses his composure, demanding to be allowed to
leave the operating room and shoving Columbo in the process. Just as it seems
that no sutures are to be found and that Mayfield is in the clear, Columbo
re-enters the doctor's office and reveals that he was puzzled as to why
Mayfield, always so calm and collected, would have shoved him, then realized
that Mayfield used the scuffle to rid himself of the sutures. Here, Columbo
pulls the sutures from the pocket of the surgical scrubs he, Columbo himself,
had worn in the operating room - "the only thing not searched". The hitherto
impassive Mayfield shows the first signs of distress. Nita Talbot plays
Marsha, Sharon Martin's roommate.

Apart from season 10's "No Time to Die", which had no murderer and is a vast
divergence from the series formula, this is the only Columbo episode in which
a murderer fails to kill his intended target.

how to murder someone and get away with it [Heart surgeon Dr. Barry Mayfield found himself presented with an opportunity to ingeniously get rid of one his senior colleagues that was standing in the way of his career: Dr. Mayfield was called on to perform heart surgery on said colleague. While doing so, he clandestinely replaced the normal sutures to be used with dissolving sutures dyed to look the same. These would have dissolved a few days later and the patient would have died of heart failure that would have been hard to pin on anyone. He would surely have gotten away with it had it not been for the timely intervention of Lieutenant Columbo. Dr. Mayfield also murdered a hospital nurse and a recovered drug addict to cover his tracks.]

medical risk taking [The research colleagues Dr. Mayfield and Dr. Hiedemann were at odds over whether to announce their apparent medical breakthrough immediately or wait for the results of more tests. Dr. Mayfield was eager to publish their result. The elder partner, Dr. Hiedemann, had a more cautious attitude, and insisted on performing some additional tests.

The Most Dangerous Match

:: Date
1973-03-04

:: Description
When Chess Grandmaster Emmett Clayton loses an impromptu game to Eastern
European champion Tomlin Dudek the night before their championship match,
Clayton decides to kill Dudek. The hearing impaired Clayton shoves him into a
garbage grinder in the basement. Dudek survives so Clayton poisons his rival
in the hospital before he can regain consciousness. Heidi Brühl plays Linda
Robinson, who follows in her mother's footsteps in looking after Dudek. Lloyd
Bochner plays Dudek's accompanying coach, Mazoor Berozski.

Final clue/twist: Columbo learns that Dudek's injuries were caused by the fall
into the grinder rather than by the grinder itself, and that the machinery
automatically shuts off if something falls into it while it is in operation.
Realizing that someone wanting to kill Dudek would merely have had to turn the
grinder back on after it shut itself off, Columbo concludes that since it was
not turned back on it means Dudek’s attacker did not know the grinder had shut
itself off. This in turn means the culprit must be deaf.

This is one of two episodes (the other is season 10's "A Bird in the Hand...")
in which Columbo himself is present at a victim's death.

how to murder someone and get away with it [Emmett Clayton realized he was about to loose to Tomlin Dudek in a fated chess game and therefore tried to dispose of his rival in the following seemingly clever way: He would trick Tomlin into writing a farewell note in his native language then push him into a garbage grinder in the basement. Alas, being deaf he failed to notice that the garbage grinder did not start. Even so he might have gotten away with it had it not been for the ever-pesky Lieutenant Columbo.]

tabletop games [The story concerns a chess master who murders his opponent the night before their high profile match was scheduled to take place. Columbo was playing checkers with the veterinarian.]
competitiveness [Emmet Clayton was an extraordinarily competitive chess player.]

Double Shock

:: Date
1973-03-25

:: Description
Flamboyant television chef Dexter Paris and his identical twin brother,
conservative banker Norman, are supposedly not talking to one another. But
both disapprove that their uncle Clifford Paris has become engaged to young,
beautiful Lisa Chambers. One of the brothers kills uncle Clifford by dropping
an electric mixer into the bathtub while he is bathing, electrocuting him. The
body is moved to the gym to make it seem like he had a heart attack while
using an exercise bike. Clifford's lawyer, Michael Hathaway reveals to the
twins that a new will exists, one which he is willing to "lose" for a price.
However, Chambers, who became fearful when Columbo questioned her, also has a
copy of the will, and thus she is murdered too. Unlike most Columbo episodes,
this has a whodunit element which is not resolved until the end of the
episode. Dabney Coleman plays Columbo's colleague, Detective Murray. Jeanette
Nolan plays Mrs. Peck, a sharp-tongued, fastidious, loyal housekeeper who is
appalled by the "terrible mess" Columbo makes in the house.

Final clue/twist: The audience has seen one of the twin brothers commit the
murder, but does not know which one. During much of the episode both twins try
to convince Columbo the other is the killer. Columbo eventually establishes
that two persons must have been involved in the actual murder. Due to the
short time frame between the short circuit caused by the electrocution and the
re-powering of the house, and due to the physical exertion required to drag
the dead body out of the bathtub and prop it up on a stationary bike, he
realizes the brothers must have worked together. When confronted, Norman
admits to what they did, while Dexter screams at him to shut up.

:: Description
Cosmetics queen Viveca Scott has developed a seemingly magic wrinkle remover,
but her former lover, Karl Lessing, a chemist for her company, knows the
formula and intends to sell it to Scott's rival, David Lang. Lessing refuses
to sell it back to her at any price, and when he taunts Scott, she bludgeons
him to death and covers up her tracks as best she can. Lang's secretary,
Shirley Blaine, has been giving information to Scott about his operation, and,
knowing about Lessing's negotiations with Lang, she attempts to blackmail
Scott. So Scott kills her too.

Final clue/twist: Columbo notices Viveca itching and, as he suffers in the
same way, he realizes they both have poison ivy and must have contacted it
from the same source. Scott suspects the wrinkle remover is responsible for
her itching. However, Columbo tells her the poison ivy was actually on the
slide of Lessing's microscope, shards of which they both touched – he while
examining the crime scene, while she could only have done it around the time
that Lessing was killed.

Wine connoisseur Adrian Carsini runs a small winery specializing in
unprofitable but prized wines. He is about to be named the wine industry's
Man-of-the-Year. His half-brother, Rick, only wants to spend money on various
hobbies and interests like sports and fast cars and has also been married
several times. When Rick gets tired of Adrian's indulgences, he announces his
decision to sell the land to mass producers of cheap, profitable wines. Adrian
knocks him unconscious and leaves him to die in an airtight wine cellar. He
travels to New York to accept the award and attend wine auctions, at the same
time establishing his alibi. Upon his return, he concocts a scuba diving
accident to explain Rick's death by suffocation. Julie Harris plays Adrian's
formidable secretary, who realizes that Columbo suspects Carsini of killing
his brother, and has plans of her own for Carsini.

Final clue/twist: Columbo realizes Carsini had locked Rick in the airtight
wine cellar with the air conditioning turned off, and realizes further that
this happened when a heatwave had struck Los Angeles. Columbo steals a very
rare bottle of wine (Ferrier Vintage Port 1945) from Carsini’s cellar, and
when he treats Carsini and his secretary to dinner, arranges for the
restaurant staff to serve it to them. Carsini, upon tasting the wine, explodes
in anger and berates the staff for exposing it to very high temperatures.
Columbo tells Carsini that reminds him of the recent heatwave. Carsini
realizes that all the wine in his cellar would have been spoiled in the
heatwave, so that night he sets out to destroy all the bottles. A heart-broken
Carsini is caught in the act by Columbo and confesses, expressing relief that
at least he does not any more have to deal with his secretary, who had guessed
the truth and was pressuring him to marry her.

Harry Stone, a campaign manager for Nelson Hayward, is coercing the womanizing
senatorial candidate  to end his affair with his wife Vickie's personal
secretary Linda, which Stone regards as too risky during a campaign. Stone is
also the mastermind of a publicity stunt that involves fabricating death
threats against Hayward, to promote his tough stance against crime. Hayward
uses this to his advantage: he lures Stone to his own beach house (while
driving Hayward's car and wearing Hayward's coat), where the candidate shoots
and kills Stone, making it look like a case of mistaken identity at the hands
of the phantom assassins.

Final clue/twist: Hayward, realizing that Columbo is coming closer to solving
the murder, stages a phony assassination attempt on himself. He fires a
silenced gun through a balcony window into his private hotel room. He later
gets rid of the gun. Hours later he returns to the room, ignites a firecracker
to mimic a gunshot, and claims that someone has just shot at him from outside.
When the police express shock at the brazenness of the alleged shooter, he
feigns outrage at them doubting his word, and demands that the bullet be
removed from the wall and analyzed. Columbo reveals that the ballistics of the
bullet are already in, and that it indeed was fired from the murder weapon. He
explains that after Hayward had been alone in the room (a time when he
ostensibly was making phone calls), Columbo had searched it and found the hole
in the window and the bullet in the wall. He had done this hours before
Hayward claimed someone had just shot at him.

Double Exposure

:: Date
1973-12-16

:: Description
Dr. Bart Keppel is a "motivation research specialist" at Impulse Research Labs
who has become an expert practitioner of subliminal advertising (which
involves inserting frames of an advertised product into the reels of a film,
so viewers' subconscious minds react to what is pictured). Keppel's more
lucrative sideline is blackmail: he takes pictures of married clients with
attractive women he hired to get them in compromising positions. When his
latest victim, Vic Norris, refuses to be blackmailed and threatens to expose
him, Keppel plots to kill him. Keppel serves salty caviar at a reception he is
hosting for his clients prior to showing them his latest promotional film.
Subliminal photos of a refreshing drink are inserted into the film, which,
when it is shown, lure Norris out of the screening room. Keppel is supposedly
narrating the film as it is playing, but in reality the clients are hearing
Keppel's voice playing from a tape recorder. When Norris is lured out, Keppel
shoots him in the building lobby. Keppel has already set in motion a scheme to
make it seem that the crime was committed by Norris's wife. Keppel's
projectionist, Roger White, then discovers the cuts in the film and pieces
together Keppel's scheme, forcing Keppel to murder him as well when Roger
tries to blackmail him.

Final clue/twist: Columbo uses Keppel’s technique against him. He arranges to
splice into a film, which Keppel will soon view, many subliminal cuts of
images of Columbo closely searching areas where the murder weapon must be. On
seeing the cuts, an alarmed Keppel rushes to his office to make sure the
weapon is still where he left it. Columbo is waiting there, hidden, and when
Keppel retrieves the evidence, Columbo is there to seize it.

This episode received the Emmy Award in the category for Outstanding Limited

:: Description
Publisher Riley Greenleaf decides to kill his prolific author Alan Mallory,
for the insurance and also to keep him from defecting to another publisher. He
hires ex-con and avid homemade bomb enthusiast Eddie Kane to do the job. While
Greenleaf is getting drunk at a nearby bar, Kane walks into Mallory's office
and shoots him. To cover his tracks, Greenleaf then kills Kane with one of his
own bombs, making it look like an accident. Columbo must discover the link
between the two crimes.

Final clue/twist: Greenleaf hands over an old synopsis to Columbo, claiming it
was Kane’s, which allegedly proves that Kane had the idea for Mallory's latest
book, and murdered him out of revenge for Mallory's having stolen it. Columbo
finds out, however, that the ending of the book was actually developed very
shortly before the murder, by Mallory and his agent, to make sure the book was
more appealing for a Hollywood film adaptation. Kane could not have known the
new ending, so the synopsis must have been done by Greenleaf.

This episode has a split screen of Greenleaf's alibi and Mallory's murder.
Mariette Hartley's role is similar to the one she played in Season 7's "Try
and Catch Me". Spillane was the real-life author of Mike Hammer detective
mysteries. Cassidy played the villain in three Columbo episodes: this one,
Murder by the Book and Now You See Him...

Mind over Mayhem

:: Date
1974-02-10

:: Description
When Dr. Howard Nicholson threatens to expose Neil Cahill for plagiarizing a
paper from a recently deceased scientist, Neil's father, Dr. Marshall Cahill,
director of a high-tech Pentagon think tank, kills Nicholson to protect his
son's reputation. He programs a cybernetic robot codenamed MM-7 to take his
place overseeing a war exercise. The elder Cahill steals a car from the motor
pool and drives to Nicholson's house. In the driveway, Cahill runs over
Nicholson, then carries his body into the house, ransacking it to make it look
like a burglary. To cover up damage the car received from the impact, Cahill
backs his own car into it, with many witnesses to the accident. Nicholson's
wife happens to be Neil's psychotherapist.

Final clue/twist: Columbo realizes early on that Marshall is the likely
murderer after finding a burned match at Nicholson's home (Nicholson's wife
doesn't smoke and Nicholson himself used a pipe lighter; therefore the match
points to a cigar smoker, which Marshall is), but fails to unearth solid
evidence against him. Columbo discovers that Marshall’s motive was based on
his love for his son. Columbo frames and arrests the son, which causes the
father to confess. This episode provides perhaps the most glaring example of
Columbo using ethically dubious means to secure a murderer’s apprehension.

:: Description
Gospel-singing superstar Tommy Brown is hugely successful, but he is unable to
enjoy the usual benefits of fame and wealth. His zealous wife Edna can prove
he had committed statutory rape with one of his backup singers, Maryann. She
watches him carefully when he is touring, and even blackmails him into giving
all the proceeds from his concerts to her ministry. Tommy decides to kill Edna
and Maryann. He drugs both women to sleep while piloting a small, private
plane flying to Los Angeles, then parachutes from the plane before it crashes
into desert mountains. Brown lands roughly, hurting his leg. He hides the
parachute and lies down near the burning plane wreckage, making it seem like
he was thrown clear in a tragic crash caused by flying through bad weather.
The FAA investigator is ready to rule the crash was an accident. Edna's
brother, Luke appeals to Columbo to consider the case a possible homicide,
based on his mistrust of Tommy.

Final clue/twist: Columbo’s investigation leads him to conclude that Brown
must have used a home-made parachute to jump from the plane in midair, which
he then hid somewhere in the mountains. Columbo tells Brown that a boy scout
troop will be scouring the mountains for any wreckage from the crash. However,
Brown seems unperturbed. At the airport before Brown is about to fly off to a
concert, Columbo notices Brown taking his car rental keys with him onto the
plane. Because he doesn't return the keys, Columbo concludes that Brown must
be returning to Los Angeles. That night Brown drives up into the mountains and
unearths the parachute, but he is caught bringing it back to the rental car by
Columbo, hiding in wait. A relieved Brown asks Columbo if he's afraid to be
alone with a killer; Columbo plays Brown's songs and says anyone who sings
that well can't be all bad.

A Friend in Deed

:: Date
1974-05-05

:: Description
When Hugh Caldwell accidentally kills his wife during a fight, he calls his
friend and neighbor, LAPD Deputy Commissioner Mark Halperin. Halperin helps
Caldwell cover up the crime, then forces him to assist the following night in
the drowning-murder of Halperin's own wife, a wealthy heiress whose money
Halperin covets. Halperin arranges the situation to make it seem that a cat
burglar, who has recently been active in their neighborhood, is the culprit in
both killings, and orders Columbo to tailor his investigation to that theory.

Final clue/twist: Columbo enlists the burglar's help in trapping the true
murderers. Columbo creates fake files for the "burglary investigation" on
which Halperin had ordered him to concentrate. While perusing the file,
ostensibly to help Columbo, Halperin notes the burglar’s address. He hides
jewelry taken from one of the murder scenes there, and shortly thereafter
leads a raid on that apartment. Columbo confronts Halperin and accuses him of
being involved in the murders. Halperin threatens Columbo’s job, and is
triumphant when the planted jewelry is found in the searched apartment.
However Columbo reveals that he himself is renting the apartment, that the
burglar has no connection to it. Since only Columbo and Halperin knew that
address, Halperin must have planted the jewelry there, which in turns means he
must have been involved in the murders.

The first murder victim, Janice Caldwell, is killed before the episode begins,
and is seen only as a corpse. The actress playing the part is unknown.

An Exercise in Fatality

:: Date
1974-09-15

:: Description
Renowned exercise guru Milo Janus runs a chain of successful gyms. His charm
is not enough to calm the anger of franchise owner Gene Stafford, who has
found out how Janus overcharges his franchises for equipment and supplies,
depositing the profits in offshore bank accounts. When Stafford threatens to
organize other victims of Janus and to go public with a class action suit,
Janus kills him. He makes it look like Stafford was working out, trying to
lift weights too heavy for him, with the result being that the barbell fell
and crushed his windpipe.

Final clue/twist: From the way the shoelaces on the corpse were tied, Columbo
deduces that Stafford did not tie his own sport shoes. Columbo concludes that
the murderer must have put the shoes on Stafford’s feet, when he dressed the
corpse in exercise clothing, and only Janus knew before the discovery of the
body that Stafford was wearing exercise gear. Throughout the episode multiple
hints to the solution are given (including a sustained close-up of the
victim's shoes, Columbo tying his own shoes several times, Columbo discussing
his shoes with other characters, and by a character named "Lacy").

Negative Reaction

1974-10-14

:: Description
After years of marriage to his domineering wife, Frances, professional
photographer Paul Galesko decides to kill her. He hires ex-con Alvin Deschler
to rent an isolated ranch house. Galesko persuades his wife to accompany him
there and she grudgingly agrees. He ties her to a chair, photographs the
scene, and then shoots her. He sets things up so it will appear he is
elsewhere when the pictures were taken. Galesko meets Deschler at a junkyard.
After shooting Deschler with a revolver, Galesko shoots himself in the leg
with the pistol used in the first murder, then plants that gun on Deschler so
that it will appear the "kidnapper" was killed in self-defense. JoAnna Cameron
plays Galesko's assistant, with whom he is planning a romantic getaway.

Final clue/twist: Columbo stages a false accusation using a mirror-inverted
version of the kidnapping photo Galesko used to fabricate an alibi. The
reverse negative shows a different time on a clock in the photo, a time for
which Galesko has no alibi. An increasingly riled Galesko accuses Columbo of
framing him with false evidence, and becomes more incensed when Columbo tells
him the original photo was accidentally destroyed. Galesko grabs a camera from
a shelf where there are twelve other cameras, and shows Columbo a negative
that is still inside it. Galesko says the negative proves him right about
which way the clock is pointing in the original photograph. Galesko has thus
given himself away. He had no way of knowing which camera had been used as
part of the kidnapping scheme, or that the negative was still in the back of
that camera. Galesko, defeated, realizes that Columbo had staged the false
arrest with the exact purpose of getting him to lose his cool so he would
rashly identify the camera. The outside set of Deschler's hotel room is the
set of Psycho.

By Dawn's Early Light

:: Date
1974-10-27

:: Description
Colonel Lyle C. Rumford (Patrick McGoohan), head of the Haynes Military
Academy, an all-boys school, is told by the Board of Trustees president
William Haynes (Tom Simcox), with whom Rumford has a contentious relationship,
that due to declining enrollment it must be converted into a coed school.
Haynes also makes clear that Rumford will no longer be in charge of the
revamped institution. Rumford rigs a school cannon by blocking its discharge
with a cleaning rag, then modifies a shell with a more powerful explosive so
that the cannon will explode when Haynes fires it the next morning, at a
ceremonial occasion. Rumford pins the accident on a cadet, Roy Springer (Mark
Wheeler), who has a history of behavioral demerits. Eventually Rumford’s own
fanatical sense of duty provides Columbo the clues that lead to Rumford’s
incrimination. Final clue/twist: Rumford, an absolute stickler for the
academy’s rules, is determined to find a bottle of prohibited cider that he
knows is on the premises. Columbo himself finds the cider, and realizes there
is a connection between it and the murder. He gains the confidence of the
cadets who made the cider, and has them tell him everything about how and when
it was made. Once he learns that information, he asks Rumford if he had seen
the cider previously. When Rumford says yes, it incriminates him. Columbo
tells him he could have seen the cider only on the morning of the murder (the
cider had been hung out to ferment at night, and as such was only visible
around sunrise), and only if he was standing very near the cannon (because of
the location of the trees on the academy grounds). So on the morning of the
murder Rumford was not asleep, as he had claimed; instead, he must have been
at the cannon.

With this episode McGoohan won the first of his two Emmy Awards for
Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series. His second was for Agenda for
Murder. Father and son Bruce Kirby and Bruno Kirby co-star, as a sergeant and
a cadet, respectively. Bruce Kirby appears in a number of Columbo episodes.
Madeleine Sherwood plays Rumford's no-nonsense secretary. Location filming
took place at The Citadel in South Carolina.

Troubled Waters

:: Date
1975-02-09

:: Description
While aboard a Mexican cruise he takes frequently, auto executive Hayden
Danziger (Robert Vaughn) has been having an affair with the lounge singer
Rosanna Wells (Poupée Bocar). When Wells threatens to expose their affair to
Danziger's wife, Sylvia (Jane Greer), Danziger decides to get rid of Wells. To
set up his alibi, he inhales some amyl nitrite to feign a heart attack in the
swimming pool, so that he will be checked into the ship's hospital.  During a
lapse in security, Danziger dons a crewman's uniform, sneaks out of his
hospital bed, and waits in Wells's cabin for her performance break. When Wells
comes back, Danziger shoots her, plants evidence to implicate a band musician,
Lloyd Harrington (Dean Stockwell) – who had been in a  relationship with Wells
before she discarded him – ditches the pistol, and returns to the hospital
before the doctors can find him missing. Columbo, vacationing on the cruise
with his wife, is pressed into service by the ship's captain (Patrick Macnee).
Bernard Fox and Robert Douglas also guest star.

Final clue/twist: Columbo convinces Danziger that he can only arrest
Harrington if they find the gloves he used during the murder, which would have
gunpowder residue on them. So Danziger puts on another pair of rubber gloves
and, down in the ship’s engines where he cannot be heard, fires a gun from the
magician’s show. The gloves are then conveniently left by Danziger to be found
by the ship’s crew. However when given the gloves to analyze, Columbo is no
longer interested in powder burns, instead he finds Danziger's fingerprints on
the inside of the gloves.

Harold Van Wick (Oskar Werner), the controlling, arrogant, gadget-obsessed
president of Midas Electronics, has wired his estate-home with closed-circuit
television cameras and video recorders. His mother-in-law Margaret Midas
(Martha Scott), who owns the company, and who blames a steep drop in profits
on Van Wick's costly fascination with obscure gadgetry, orders him to resign
his post by the following morning, or she will expose his philandering ways to
his wife, her daughter, Elizabeth (Gena Rowlands). Van Wick has already set in
motion a scheme to murder her. He rigs his high-tech home security system and
shoots Margaret when she is in the viewing field of one camera, feeding a
recording of an empty study to the guard monitoring the estate's rooms. Having
already forced open a window and planted footprints outside it to make the
murder look like the deed of a burglar, he then uses a timer to play back the
tape of the shooting to the gatehouse guard's monitor to make it look like
Margaret was shot by an intruder after Van Wick had left the house for a
party. Robert Brown played Arthur Midas, Margaret's son and Elizabeth's
brother. Patricia Barry plays the owner of an art gallery which provided Van
Wick with his ostensible alibi, and Trisha Noble plays her sexy assistant, who
may have had an affair with Van Wick.

Final clue/twist: Columbo notices, while viewing security monitor recordings
from both before and after the murder, that Van Wick's invitation for the
party was still on his desk after leaving for the party. Van Wick had
presented the invitation to get access to the party that provided his alibi.
So Margaret had to have been shot sometime before the security guard viewed it
on the monitor, and, more damningly, Van Wick would practically have had to
step over the body to retrieve his invitation before leaving for the party.

A Deadly State of Mind

:: Date
1975-04-27

:: Description
Psychiatrist Dr. Mark Collier (George Hamilton) is having an affair with a
patient of his, rich housewife Nadia Donner (Lesley Ann Warren). One day,
Nadia invites Mark to a weekend sex vacation at the Donner beach house.
Collier shows up at the beach house only to be unpleasantly surprised by
Nadia's husband, Carl (Stephen Elliott). The two men get into a violent
confrontation over Collier's affair with and drugging of Nadia, with Carl
threatening to damage Collier's reputation. When Collier surprises Carl by
attempting to leave with Nadia in tow, Carl attacks him. A scuffle ensues,
which ends with Collier bludgeoning Carl with a fireplace poker. After telling
Nadia to explain it to the police as a home invasion that turned tragic, done
by several masked men, Collier drives off, almost running over a blind man
walking his dog past the beach house. Investigating the scene, Columbo is not
satisfied with Nadia's version of events, wondering why Nadia didn't see the
headlights of the burglars' car. When Columbo tells Collier that Nadia's story
is not credible, Collier secretly hypnotizes her into, in effect, committing
suicide by taking a deadly dive from her fifth floor balcony into the swimming
pool below.

Final clue/twist: Columbo claims to have a witness to the first murder.
Collier is confronted with the eyewitness, a man wearing dark sunglasses who
looks just like the blind man Collier narrowly avoided hitting with his car
shortly after the murder. The man settles down on the couch, hands Columbo a
match, and then identifies Collier as the driver he saw at around the time of
the murder. Collier, as confident as ever, says that he has not been fooled,
that he knows the man is blind, and thus cannot be a witness to anything.
Collier challenges the man to read from a magazine he hands him, and is
stunned when the man does read from it. Columbo reveals that the man is the
brother of the actual blind man. But Collier has incriminated himself. In
“knowing” that the witness was blind, he has established that he was at the
scene of the crime. He has in effect been an eyewitness against himself.

Forgotten Lady

:: Date
1975-09-14

:: Description
When elderly physician Henry Willis (Sam Jaffe) refuses to finance a return to
the spotlight for his wife, aging former movie star Grace Wheeler (Janet
Leigh) kills him in his sleep, passing it off as a suicide. Their elderly
butler (Maurice Evans) believes Grace was in a private screening room the
entire time, watching one of her classic films. Final clue/twist: Columbo
believes that a discrepancy between the length of the movie and the time it
took Grace Wheeler to watch it, including the few minutes it took her to fix
the film after it ripped, proves that Grace spent some time away from the
screening room. It was then, Columbo concludes, that she was out committing
the murder. This is one of the only two episodes in which the perpetrator is
not arrested (the other being "It's All In The Game"), as Ned Diamond (John
Payne), Wheeler's longtime song and dance partner who has always loved Grace,
falsely confesses to save her after Columbo informs him she is suffering from
a degenerative brain disease (the primary reason her husband refused to
finance her return as the physical strain of acting would have killed her) and
likely no longer even remembers the murder. Nonetheless, Columbo is prepared
to arrest her. Diamond makes his false confession to Grace who briefly becomes
hysterical. Columbo arrests Diamond, both realizing that by the time he is
cleared, Grace will have died. Columbo's normal instincts thwarted, he makes
several half turns – as though to enter the screening room – where Grace, lost
in the past, is watching the film, having already forgotten Diamond's
confession. Columbo then leaves the mansion, following Diamond. The episode
features excerpts from the 1953 musical comedy Walking My Baby Back Home,
which starred Leigh. It is Grace's favorite film, the one playing when she was
committing the crime and the one she is watching, mesmerized, at the end of
the episode.

An amusing concurrent side-story concerns Columbo's penchant for not carrying
his firearm and his decade-long lapse in going to the range for shooting
proficiency. He has been evading Sgt. Leftkowitz (Francine York) whose
computer records show the lapses. Finally, while Columbo is eating an ice
cream cone with his dog, an Internal Affairs officer tells him he has 24 hours
to appear at the range or his badge will be pulled. (Columbo lends his badge
to a crony whom he asks to go to the range in his place, claiming he cannot
pass the shooting proficiency test.)

A Case of Immunity

:: Date

:: Description
Hassan Salah (Héctor Elizondo), chief diplomat of the Legation of Suari, an
Arab nation with a new young king, has a scheme for shifting power within his
government. He enlists Rachman Habib (Sal Mineo), a naïve idealist in the
Legation, to help him stage the murder of a security officer, then plants
evidence to make it look like the work of radicals.  Salah pins the murder on
the now-absent Habib, who, as part of the plan, has gone into hiding.  Salah
later kills Habib as well.  Columbo unravels the truth, but finds himself
stymied by Salah's diplomatic immunity.  Columbo then meets the new king, who
is on a diplomatic visit to the United States, and is liked by the young
monarch.

Final clue/twist: Columbo gets Salah, still under diplomatic immunity, to
confess to the murder with the king listening in from the next room. To stay
in the U.S. rather than be sent back to Suari and the torture that it is
implied he would face, Salah signs a confession and waives his immunity from
prosecution.

A CIA operative code-named "Geronimo" (Leslie Nielsen) contacts fellow CIA-
operative, now working undercover as speech-writing consultant Nelson Brenner
(Patrick McGoohan, who also directed), to demand his share of money from a
previous operation they were involved in. The go-between is Otis Young. It
motivates Brenner to kill Geronimo. Columbo finds himself blocked at every
turn by a man who knows a lot of private and classified secrets, and even by a
visit from the Director of the Agency (David White). Final clue/twist:
Brenner's alibi, a taped speech for a client, is proven false when Columbo
establishes that some statements in the speech were based on news that was not
known until hours after the recording was allegedly made.

The episode features another French car, the Citroën SM. An inside joke is
that the Director's name is Philip Corrigan (aka Secret Agent X-9). In a nod
to McGoohan's role on The Prisoner, his character repeatedly uses the phrase
"Be seeing you" in the episode.

Retired and renowned matador Luis Montoya (Ricardo Montalban) is a Mexican
national hero. His trusted bookkeeper, Hector Rangel (Robert Carricart)'s son
Curro is also a bullfighter.  When Curro (A Martinez) is gored in the
bullring, Montoya freezes up in fear and does not challenge the bull. He later
decides to kill Hector, who knows what happened. Montoya lures Hector to the
ring, where he shoots him with a tranquilizer gun, and unleashes the bull on
the prone man. The result is that it appears Hector tried to take revenge on
the bull that gored his son. Columbo, who just happens to be in Tijuana for
the weekend, is recognized by a suspicious local chief of police (Pedro
Armendáriz Jr.), who enlists Columbo's help.  Final clue/twist: Due to the
condition of the muleta used to attract the bull, Columbo deduces the time
frame of the murder, a period for which Montoya has no alibi. To prove
Montoya's motive, Columbo persuades Curro to lure Montoya into the ring. The
bull is then released, and the ex-matador again becomes paralyzed with fear,
this time in front of witnesses. This episode is noteworthy as the murderer's
motive is not revealed until the very end.

Montoya watches a film of himself as a matador, which uses footage from the
1947 movie Fiesta, in which Montalban plays a matador.

The Great Santini (Jack Cassidy) is a magician extraordinaire at a cabaret. He
is also being blackmailed by his insatiably greedy employer, impresario Jesse
Jerome (Nehemiah Persoff), over the fact that he is actually Sergeant Stefan
Mueller, a former Nazi SS prison guard. Mueller tires of the arrangement and
Jerome's demand for more money, and kills his blackmailer in the middle of his
famed water tank escape act, giving himself what he believes to be an airtight
alibi. He sneaks out of a room where he hides during the act, makes his way
dressed as a waiter through the cabaret's kitchen and up to Jerome's office,
shoots him, then returns to his act with nobody noticing. Robert Loggia plays
Harry Blandford, the club's maître d' and Jerome's less than enthusiastic
business partner, whose personality was such that another character says of
the late Jerome, "To know him was to detest him." Final clue/twist: Santini is
undone by the used carbon ribbon on Jerome's IBM Selectric typewriter. The
carbon ribbon has a clear imprint of everything written with it, so it is in
effect a copy of the letter Jerome was typing to send to federal authorities,
which revealed the motive for the murder. At his arrest Santini remarks that
he thought he had created the perfect murder; Columbo remarks that a "perfect
murder" is only an illusion.

This was Cassidy's third and final Columbo episode. In all three he played the
killer.

Last Salute to the Commodore

:: Date
1976-05-02

:: Description
Commodore Otis Swanson (John Dehner) is a retired naval officer who owns a
shipbuilding company, and is not happy with the shady dealings of his son-in-
law Charles Clay (Robert Vaughn), who has turned the modest and upstanding
business into a name-brand production line for status-seekers. Nor is he
pleased with any of the people closest to him - his alcoholic daughter Joanna
Clay (Diane Baker), his middle-aged playboy nephew Swanny Swanson (Fred
Draper), his lawyer Jonathan Kittering (Wilfrid Hyde-White), and his shipyard
manager Wayne Taylor (Joshua Bryant). He announces at his birthday party his
intention to sell the company. That night, someone murders the Commodore.
Although we don't see the murder on-screen, Clay is seen covering up the death
by taking the Commodore's body out on his yacht at night and throwing it
overboard. Columbo investigates with the help of a veteran sergeant and a
29-year-old rookie. The detective's conviction that Clay committed the crime
proves premature and inaccurate, an unusual development for Columbo.  Clay
himself turns up dead and Columbo realizes that someone else is responsible
for both murders. Final clue/twist: When Columbo holds what he says is
Commodore Swanson's pocket watch to every suspect's ear, only Swanny disputes
it, saying "'Tisn't" when he hears it ticking. The watch was broken at the
time of the murder to create a false time frame, and only the murderer would
have known the watch no longer works.(Clay's motive for covering up the murder
is because he thought the killer was his wife due to planted evidence by
Swanny; he was killed when he realized who the real killer was)

This episode departs from the usual Columbo format in several ways. First, the
man implied to be the killer is not, and thus the episode becomes a true
whodunit, with the actual murderer revealed at the end.  Second, neither of
the two murders is shown.  Third, Columbo's personality is atypically
agitated, impatient and less superficially amiable than in most other
episodes.  Fourth, regular clichés such as "Just one more thing" and
"Something's been bothering me" are absent from this episode.  Fifth, rather
than working alone, Columbo works closely alongside two other police officers
(played by Bruce Kirby and Dennis Dugan), who at times interrogate suspects.
Finally, the episode departs from the usual style in presenting a far greater
emphasis on comedy, including some minor slapstick elements, and features a
less dramatic tone.

Korean War. Fowler drugs a friend staying at his house watching a baseball
game, puts it on tape delay, then dons a ski mask and pretends to rob a
delicatessen where Claire is shopping. After Fowler knocks the proprietor
unconscious and takes Claire's money, he shoots her dead, then ditches the gun
and mask. He begins stepping in and out of character to "assist" Columbo with

The Lytton family owns and operates an antiquities museum. Ruth Lytton (Joyce
Van Patten) has dedicated her life to the museum, never marrying and having no
children, although her niece Janie (Jeannie Berlin) is as close to her as a
daughter. Her brother Edward (Tim O'Connor) is not nearly as dedicated to the
family business as Ruth is; in fact, he plans to close the museum and sell the
building, as it's been losing money for years. Ruth and Edward's sister (and
Janie's mother) Phyllis Brandt (Celeste Holm) is a checked-out alcoholic who
is likely to go along with Edward's decision. Ruth enlists Milton Schaeffer
(Peter Feibleman), an ex-con who works as a guard at the museum, and whose
brother Tim is having an affair with Janie, in a complex plot where Milton
will steal some artifacts from the museum, fake his own death, and then flee
the country while Ruth collects the insurance money. But her real goal is
revealed when she  double-crosses Milton during the robbery, and shoots him
dead, then kills Edward when he comes to investigate the gunshot. She then
plants guns on both men to make it look like they killed each other. When Ruth
realizes Columbo has not fallen for the staged robbery, she tries to frame
Janie for involvement in the crimes.

Final clue/twist: Ruth plants an ancient belt buckle in Janie's room to frame
her, and Janie is arrested for the murders. Columbo takes the buckle to
Janie's prison cell. When Janie uses it as an ashtray, Columbo knows she has
no idea what it is, so she could not possibly have had a hand in its theft.
Columbo comes to believe that, many years before, Ruth killed Janie's father,
Peter Brandt, whom she was going to marry until Phyllis snatched him away. To
protect Janie, who does not know much about her father’s death and his
relationships with the women in his life, Ruth persuades Columbo not to pursue
those questions and in return she will confess to the two current murders.

of the other people in the society, to trap him. After Columbo presents a
ridiculous solution to how the murder took place, specifically on how the
murderer timed things so the sounds of gunshots were heard coming from

Esteemed mystery author Abigail Mitchell (Ruth Gordon) is convinced that her
sole relative, her nephew-in-law Edmund Galvin (Charles Frank), murdered his
wife, Mitchell's niece Phyllis, in a boating "accident" four months earlier
and got away with it. Not only that, but Galvin inherited the rights to a play
of Mitchell's, which Mitchell had long ago signed over to Phyllis as a
present. Mitchell decides to take revenge and murder her nephew-by-marriage.
She tricks Galvin into a false sense of security by making him her heir. Then
she lures him into her large walk-in safe and slams the door shut, locking him
in. Galvin, locked in an airless and sound-proofed safe for the whole weekend,
suffocates while Mitchell flies off to New York. Final clue/twist: Columbo
eventually solves the case by piecing together clues left by Galvin as he
suffocated in the safe. The most incriminating is the title page of Mitchell's
latest manuscript "The Night I was Murdered", which Galvin altered to read "I
was murdered by Abigail Mitchell". At the end of the episode, Mitchell asks
Columbo if he can overlook what she did. Gordon's character is one of the most
sympathetic killers caught by Columbo and he seems genuinely sorry to have to
arrest her. However, he had earlier cautioned her not to count on his being
soft-hearted. She pays him a compliment to his cleverness by remarking that,
had he been the detective who had investigated her niece's "disappearance,"
none of this need ever have happened.

Mariette Hartley plays Mitchell's trusted assistant, Veronica Bryce, who
becomes embroiled in the crime. G. D. Spradlin plays Mitchell’s attorney, who
in one scene seems to have guessed what she had done.

Paul Gerard (Louis Jourdan) is a renowned restaurant critic, but gets rich
extorting money from upscale restaurant owners in return for good reviews.
When one of them, Vittorio Rossi (Michael V. Gazzo), decides to no longer pay
and expose Gerard, the critic kills him with a bottle of wine poisoned with
fugu.  Final clue/twist: Columbo figures out that Gerard poisoned the wine via
the needle of the bottle opener, not in the pressure cartridge itself. He
tricks Gerard into attempting to poison him in the same way, which provides
the final evidence. Columbo then tells Gerard he suspected him almost
immediately because Gerard did not rush to a hospital to be examined after the
police informed him the man he just had dinner with died from poison.
Throughout the episode, Columbo and Gerard have been respectful to one
another, but both finally admit that they dislike each other. Columbo
nonetheless asks Gerard what he thinks of the meal he has just prepared, and
the charming murderer says, "I wish you had been a chef". Richard Dysart,
France Nuyen and Larry D. Mann also appear. Antony Alda plays Rossi's nephew,
Mario, who speaks only Italian. Falk's later real-life wife Shera Danese
returns as Gerard's secretary/treasurer/mistress Eve Plummer, who is being

restaurateurs.

West Coast television production boss Mark McAndrews (Laurence Luckinbill) is
promoted to a high-level position in New York. He fails to name as his
replacement the logical successor, TV programmer Kay Freestone (Trish Van
Devere), because she is also his lover. He gives her, as a consolation prize,
a new Mercedes. She is more interested in a gun he holds while he jokingly
invites her to shoot him. Freestone takes him up on it during an important
preview for a new made-for-TV movie called "The Professional", that she helped
produce. She tricks the projectionist (James McEachin) by fiddling with the
projector's timer and then sending him on an errand. Freestone sneaks up to
McAndrews's office and shoots him, then returns, hiding the gun above the
ceiling panels of an elevator, to make the reel change successfully before the
projectionist gets back. Patrick O'Neal plays Frank Flanagan, her boss. It was
once held that Van Devere's husband, actor George C. Scott, has an uncredited
cameo as a television technician, but that claim has been debunked.

Final clue/twist: Kay sees what she thinks is the murder weapon, now visible
against the lights of the elevator ceiling. She recovers and gets rid of it.
Columbo reveals that the actual gun had been discovered by the police some
time before, and an imitation was put where she would see it, to find out what
she would do. That she got rid of what she thought was the murder weapon
proves she must be the killer.

plays the resident of Mason's guest house who discovers the body.  Ed Begley,
Jr. has a minor role as an animal control officer and Tricia O'Neil plays a
dog trainer.

Final clue/twist: When Columbo realizes that the dogs were trained to react
violently when a certain word is spoken, he has a long conversation with
Mason, hoping Mason’s ego will compel him to use the word while they talk.
This does happen. Columbo secretly recorded the conversation, and when the
tape is played to the dogs they again react with savagery. Columbo figures out
the word is "Rosebud". Columbo confronts Mason and provokes him by telling him
of all the mistakes he made. Mason orders the dogs to attack, by saying
"Rosebud" sharply and pointing to Columbo. However this time the dogs play
with Columbo instead of attacking him, as he had arranged to have them
retrained by a dog behavioural specialist.

The Conspirators

:: Date
1978-05-13

:: Description
Joe Devlin (Clive Revill) is a renowned Irish poet, author, and raconteur. He,
along with his own family and the heads of O'Connell Industries, is secretly a
fundraiser and gun-runner for the Irish Republican Army. He raises money in
Los Angeles for his radical cause through a charity ostensibly meant to help
victims of terrorism. Devlin has a strong belief in honor. Thus, when Vincent
Pauley (Albert Paulsen), an arms dealer selling guns to Devlin, tries to skim
off $50,000 for himself, Devlin shoots and kills Pauley for being a traitor.
With Columbo hot on his trail, Devlin now in possession of the guns must
arrange for their shipment out of the country. Final clue/twist: Columbo
discovers that a bottle of whiskey at the crime scene has the same glass
markings that Devlin habitually makes when he drinks from a bottle. Because
every diamond has a unique cutting habit, Devlin's ring, which he uses to mark
his bottles, is proof of his presence at the crime scene. Devlin accepts that
Columbo has caught him, and is only disturbed when at the last minute Columbo
foils his gun-smuggling scheme (Columbo had realized the guns were not yet on
a ship going out to Southampton, but were on a tugboat escorting the ship to
sea; Columbo saw the tugboat had the colors of the O'Connell shipping line).

This was the last episode of the Columbo series broadcast on the NBC
television network. Columbo's last line is "This far, and no farther", words
spoken by Devlin as he marked a whiskey bottle to determine how much he would
drink in a session.  These words were taken from a speech by the Irish
Parliamentary Party (IPP) leader Charles Stuart Parnell, a 19th-century Irish
politician and supporter of Home Rule. A noted IPP politician of the same name
as the fictional killer in this episode, Joseph Devlin, represented West
Belfast early in the 20th century and opposed the use of violence in the cause
of nationalist politics.

Columbo Goes to the Guillotine

:: Date

:: Description
Elliott Blake (Anthony Andrews) is a "psychic" who, with his
girlfriend/partner in crime Dr. Paula Hall (Karen Austin), is attempting to
scam U.S. military intelligence into hiring him to use his ESP abilities
against the Soviets. Blake and Hall rig a test with a stock set of Zener
cards, but the Army wants more proof of Blake's abilities. They bring in Max
Dyson (Anthony Zerbe), a magician with a side job in exposing fake psychics.
Dyson, who has never failed to expose frauds, comes up with a new test for
Blake. Three Army officers drive to randomly selected areas and take pictures
of whatever they see. Then they will attempt to transmit those images to Blake
with their thoughts. To the surprise and delight of the Army officials, Blake
passes the test. What they don't know, however, is that Blake and Dyson are
old acquaintances who both did time together in a Ugandan prison, and Dyson
helped his old friend rig the test for old times' sake. Unfortunately for
Dyson, Blake holds a grudge against Dyson for ratting out his escape plans to
the guards, getting himself an early release and getting Blake three more
years. Given a chance at revenge, Blake takes it: he traps Dyson in Dyson's
own homemade guillotine, and decapitates him. Columbo now has to solve the
crime before the government whisks Blake beyond his reach, changing his
identity. Final clue/twist: Columbo tricks Blake into a confession and
attempted murder by taunting him with a promise to investigate him for the
murder for as long as it takes to bring him down. When Blake tries to kill
Columbo with the guillotine, he confesses while he's pulling the plug. But
because Columbo has rigged the guillotine, he is unharmed.

This was the first episode broadcast on the ABC network and was shown under
the umbrella of The ABC Mystery Movie.

Boy genius Hollywood director Alex Brady (Fisher Stevens), prior to becoming a
success, made a 16mm movie in which a young woman, Jenny Fisher, was killed in
a motorcycle accident. Brady and his cameraman conspired to pretend that the
woman never made it to the filming, leading the official investigation to
conclude that it was an accidental death. Jenny's brother Leonard Fisher (Jeff
Perry) shows up in Brady's office with a copy of a film that was left to him
by Brady's recently deceased cameraman. Leonard vows to use the film to
destroy Brady, who kills him, using one of his studio movie sets. Final
clue/twist: When he realizes that Columbo is coming closer and closer to
solving the murder, Brady hires two actresses to enact a scripted conversation
in the studio commissary for Columbo to overhear, hoping it would misdirect
him. Columbo is not fooled, noticing that one of the actresses was dressed as
a nurse when there were no scenes filmed during the studio that day that
required one. Columbo then beats Brady at his own game, using undercover cops
to "play the part" of the commissary staff so they can overhear Brady trying
to bribe his secretary to keep quiet.

Sex therapist Dr. Joan Allenby (Lindsay Crouse) hosts a popular call-in radio
show and has authored a best-selling self-help manual, The Courtesan Complex.
She is also involved both professionally and personally with her business
partner David Kincaid (Stephen Macht). That is, until late one night when Dr.
Allenby makes an unexpected after-hours trip to her office and catches David
in flagrante delicto with her assistant Cindy Galt (Julia Montgomery) in the
therapy room. Dr. Allenby is incensed, and decides to kill David. To do so,
she takes a page right out of her own book. She first disguises herself as a
sexually aggressive, high-class prostitute named "Lisa", wearing a black wig
and sexy black clothing, that she stashes in the women's bathroom of a
fundraiser she's attending. During the fundraiser, she sneaks to the bathroom
to change into her disguise. She then sneaks out in the disguise and goes over
to a nearby bar where she's arranged for David to meet with her. Making sure
to be seen, she tricks David into taking them both back to her clinic. Once
there, she shoots him, then makes it look like the mysterious "lady in black"
committed the crime.

Final clue/twist: During their first meeting, Columbo notices that Allenby's
new coat still has the price tag attached. He later makes the link connecting
the new coat and the "lady in black" costume to the same store. He finds the
tag in the trash and is able to contact the store where the salesperson who
sold the wig to her was able to recognize Allenby from the photo of her in her
book.

:: Description
Colonel Frank Brailie (Robert Foxworth) is running a paramilitary mercenary
school owned by General Jack Padget (Stephen Elliott). Brailie is also having
an affair with Padget's wife Jenny (Janet Eilber). Brailie is siphoning money
from Padget's foundation into what he calls "The Special Projects Fund", which
is secretly used to finance illegal dealings. The suspicious General asks an
employee, Sgt. Major Lester Keegan (Andy Romano) to look into the matter.
Keegan finds the evidence but decides to blackmail Brailie instead of
reporting his findings. During a training exercise, occurring on the night of
the General's birthday party, Brailie sneaks into the mercenary camp, wearing
a ski mask, and stabs Keegan, then puts the body on a landmine that is
detonated. He sneaks back to the General's estate and makes it look like he
was assembling a diorama of the Battle of Gettysburg at the time.

Final clue/twist: Columbo realized that a shipping box labeled as having
contained books (which Brailie received earlier on the day of the murder) was
too small to contain the number of books it was supposed to contain, and thus
the box must have instead contained the toy soldiers for the diorama, and the
books must have arrived in a shipment that arrived later (which Brailie
claimed contained the toy soldiers). This meant that Brailie had swapped the
labels on the boxes and had had enough time to set up the diorama over the
course of the day, and therefore had no alibi for the time of the murder.

Barsini takes delight in the way they fight for his attention. But when Louise

robbing him. He kills Louise, then makes it look like she drowned at the beach
while he was at Vito's bar, painting. Columbo poses for Barsini while
investigating him.

Final clue/twist: Columbo can prove that a spot on Louise's face was not
washed-up make-up but was instead remnants of "Barsini red", a special color
mixed only for Barsini, and that it was on the cloth she was benumbed with.

When Dian Hunter (Deidre Hall), the partner of men's magazine publisher Sean
Brantley (Ian Buchanan), vanishes after expressing a desire to sell her 51%
interest to a rival, suspicion falls on Sean and his girlfriend Tina (Rebecca
Staab). Columbo sets out to find the body, eventually digging up much of
Brantley's estate and breaking open the walls. But after the search turns into
a full-blown media event, Dian resurfaces, explaining she needed some time to
herself. Dian and Sean planned the disappearance as a publicity stunt to
increase sales. But to his shock, she actually intends to sell now that her
holding is more valuable. Sean proceeds to then kill Dian for real and hides
the body, believing that Columbo will not be allowed to search for it again.
Richard Levinson and William Link wrote the story for this episode, but were
uncredited.

Final clue/twist: Dian apparently left wearing a fur coat. Columbo gets
suspicious when he sees all her remaining fur coats in plastic storage bags,
deducing that Brantley put the body in the missing bag. Knowing he will not be
supported in a second full search, he phones the pager Dian wears as a
wristlet: it is on her body, behind a finished section of the replacement wall
being installed; which Columbo tears down. (The word Columbo uses to ring the
pager is "Gotcha".)

Oscar Finch (Patrick McGoohan) is a lawyer who uses underhanded methods to get
his clients off, like coercing Paul Mackey (Denis Arndt), who worked for the
D.A.'s office, into destroying evidence against racketeer Frank Staplin (Louis
Zorich) in 1969. Twenty-one years later, Mackey is chosen by a presidential
candidate, Governor Montgomery (Arthur Hill), to be his Vice Presidential
running mate. Finch himself hopes that he might be appointed as the next
Attorney General. Staplin, facing another indictment, threatens to expose the
long-ago favor and ruin Finch's and Mackey's political futures if he doesn't
arrange the destruction of another document. Finch decides to murder him. He
scatters cigar ashes to make it seem he was in a late-night meeting with a
contributor when the murder occurred. Finch walks to Staplin's house, shoots
him and makes his death look like a suicide. Final clue/twist: After Columbo
learns that Staplin hadn't eaten any of the cheese on the dish at the crime
scene, but that the block of cheese had had a piece bitten off from it, he
assumes that the murderer must have taken a bite. CSI can fabricate a
toothprint from the cheese and Columbo finds more than enough samples of
Finch's toothprint on his discarded pieces of chewing gum - proving that he
was at the crime scene.

The episode is partially told in flashbacks from the funeral of Columbo's
wife. Vivian Dimitri (Helen Shaver) is a real-estate executive whose recently
deceased husband had been sent to prison by Columbo. She seeks revenge by
plotting to kill the Columbos. But first she murders her boss, Charlie
Chambers (Edward Winter), her husband's partner who avoided prison by
informing on him. Vivian shoots Chambers in his office, using her affair with
married Leland St. John (Ian McShane) to establish an alibi. Then she plants
evidence to make it look like Chambers was killed by disgruntled residents of
a new housing development he was constructing. Her plan is then to kill the
Columbos with a jar of poisoned marmalade. Roscoe Lee Browne plays her
psychiatrist, Dr. Steadman. Final clue/twist: Figuring out Dimitri's plan,
Columbo and the police fake the death of his wife. After the big "funeral",
Columbo invites Vivian into what she thinks is his house. He makes himself
toast with marmalade. While Columbo pretends to be dying of poison, Dimitri
confesses to all three murders.  He then breaks character, and tells her that
he'd suspected her all along, and had the marmalade tested as soon as she gave
it to him. They are actually in the home of another officer, who recorded the
confession, and the marmalade jar is a different one.

Dentist Wesley Corman (James Read) decides to get rid of his unfaithful wife,
Lydia (Jo Anderson), and use her money to support his gambling habit. When
Adam Evans (Marshall R. Teague), a Hollywood heartthrob having an affair with
Lydia, comes under his care, Corman puts a time-release poison made from
digitalis under a crown. It takes effect when the couple are together that
evening and Corman is playing cards, thereby framing Lydia for the murder.
Paul Burke co-stars as Horace Sherwin, Lydia's father, also a dentist. Final
clue/twist: Columbo traps Corman by taking advantage of the fact that Corman
was never good at chemistry. He orders Evans' body exhumed and demonstrates to
Corman that if there was indeed digitalis, it would have caused a chemical
reaction with the porcelain in the crown, making a blue stain on Evans' tooth
underneath the crown. Before they begin to examine Evans' mouth, Corman
confesses. Of course, Columbo faked the demonstration: there would be no such
reaction.

Jess McCurdy (Brenda Vaccaro) fails to convince her sister, best-selling
romance novelist Theresa Goren (Janet Margolin), to cancel her wedding to
Wayne Jennings (Andrew Stevens), a playboy/tennis bum half her age and a gold
digger. McCurdy impersonates her sister on the phone with Jennings and dumps
him. Jennings reacts by killing Goren - twice. He arranges an alibi for the
first murder, then returns and shoots her corpse. He allows Columbo to "catch"
him for the second murder, which he confesses, but then "learns" that he had
only shot a corpse, so is innocent of murder, which he assumes will be blamed
on a burglar.

Final clue/twist: Columbo untangles the plot with his surprisingly detailed
familiarity with the location of the tag on women's panties. He proved that
someone else put Goren's underwear onto her corpse, and that this someone
could only be a man, because only a man would put the panties on backwards. A
murderous burglar wouldn't have bothered to dress the corpse; only Jennings
would have a reason to do so, to help his alibi.

While sitting at the lecture, they monitor the parking garage using a
miniature TV camera and shoot Rusk by his car with a remote-controlled gun,
both devices being hidden in their pickup truck's engine compartment. With an
airtight alibi, the boys then plant evidence to make it look like the
professor was killed because of a Mafia exposé he was working on. Final
clue/twist: Columbo tricks the murderous duo by letting them "overhear"
details of a car owned by a suspect. After the murder weapon is found in the
car, he reveals it is actually his wife's car. Because only they could know
which car it was, they must have planted it and must be the murderers.

Wade Anders (George Hamilton) is a former security consultant, and now host of
the popular America's Most Wanted-esque crime show CrimeAlert. One day, he
gets an unexpected visit from his rival, the chain-smoking newscaster Budd
Clarke (Peter Haskell), whom he blocked from becoming the CrimeAlert host.
Clarke has resented that he was snubbed in favor of Anders, but now, he has
got some leverage that he hopes will get Anders out of the CrimeAlert chair: a
porn video that Anders starred in many years ago. Clarke plans to go public
with the tape unless Anders resigns from the show. Anders decides to kill him
rather than be disgraced by a scandal. He palms a pack of Clarke's cigarettes,
which he doctors with a few drops of alkaloid poison nicotine sulfate. Anders
then pays two visits to his production office, once that night and again the
next morning - so a surveillance tape there will show him at the office all
day. Anders then drives to Clarke's house, and switches a cigarette pack for
the poisoned pack. Once Clarke takes one of the poisoned cigarettes and dies,
Anders makes it look like Clarke had a heart attack at his desk. Final
clue/twist: Columbo can prove that the surveillance tape was fabricated,
because the trees and bushes visible in front of the office appeared to have
been trimmed in the morning, but had supposedly grown again by the evening.
The fact that Clarke's dog scratched Anders' car, making distinctive marks
because of its missing claw on one of its paws, provides further evidence that
Anders had indeed visited Clarke's house before.

Rock star Marcy Edwards (Cheryl Paris) has been the live-in lover of high-
priced murder lawyer Hugh Creighton (Dabney Coleman) for several years. He
learns that she is having an affair with someone else and throws her out of
his house. However, Marcy blackmails Creighton into letting her stay, at least
until he comes up with the $5 million she is demanding in exchange for not
filing a palimony suit against him or exposing his unconventional practice
methods. Creighton's response is to drug the champagne in her beach house and
wait until she shows up there with her current lover. Having previously
ensured that Marcy cannot drink by lacing her tea with disulfiram, Creighton
waits until her new lover is passed out, then strangles her. Her lover awakens
and flees the scene. Creighton enlists his associate, Trish Fairbanks (Shera
Danese), to help him concoct an airtight alibi, but when she finds out what he
has done, she blackmails him into a full partnership in the firm, wisely going
the extra mile by creating a contingency plan to ensure that killing her is
not an option for Creighton. Columbo cracks the case, despite the existence of
a speed-camera ticket which appears to exonerate Creighton completely. Final
clue/twist: Due to shadow angles in the picture of the speeding ticket,
Columbo can prove that Creighton's face was just a flat cut-out mask and that
Fairbanks must have been driving Creighton's speeding vehicle, and breaking
his alibi. Also, marks on Edwards neck matched the gloves found in the
gardener's truck that had been stolen, parked on a particular street where an
unusual type of tree grows, and returned. The windshield wiper wells on
Fairbanks' car collected the berries and droppings of these trees, proving
that Creighton parked her car on that street and also drove the truck there.

Down-on-his-luck photographer Freddy Brower (Gary Kroeger) wins a $30 million
lottery. But he wants to keep the money a secret from his wife Nancy (Jamie
Rose), who is divorcing him, so that she cannot make a claim for the money.
Freddy goes to his uncle, wealthy jeweler Leon Lamarr (Rip Torn), who offers
to pretend that the lottery ticket is his own until Freddy's divorce is
finalized. Unfortunately, that is where Freddy's luck runs out: he does not
know that Lamarr has recently gone bankrupt, and is also having an affair with
Nancy. Lamarr decides to kill Freddy to keep the lottery winnings for himself.
He schedules a Halloween costume party at his house, during which he sneaks
out to Freddy's apartment, knocks him out, undresses him, then drowns him in
his bathtub. Nancy calls Lamarr during the party pretending to be Freddy.
Final clue/twist: The night of the murder, Brower was taking care of a

objects, and finds the chimp's fingerprints on a medallion that was part of
Lamarr's Halloween costume, proving that Lamarr was at Brower's apartment that
night. When confronting Lamarr, Columbo calls Nancy in to thank her for her
"cooperation" and to let her know she will be the sole beneficiary of the

not only confesses to the murder, but reveals Nancy's involvement in the
crime.

Given a deadline to pay his debts, or else, chronic gambler Harold McCain
(Greg Evigan) plants a bomb under the Rolls-Royce of his uncle, professional
football team owner Big Fred (Steve Forrest). The bomb is set to explode when
the engine is started. However, someone else gets to Big Fred before Harold's
bomb does by stealing the gardener's pickup truck and running him over while
he is jogging. Harold tries to remove the bomb before it kills someone else,
but cannot get near the Rolls-Royce due to police and security on the
premises. When the gardener tries to move the Rolls-Royce out of the way of
the TV camera crews, the bomb explodes, killing the gardener. Columbo
investigates and discovers clues that link Harold to the car bomb, but Harold
denies any involvement and tries to divert suspicion away from himself. Fred's
wife Dolores (Tyne Daly), appears traumatised at losing her husband but has a
good time as Fred's team's owner, but after Harold tries to squeeze her for
money, he is shot dead in his cabin, making it appear obvious who is
responsible. Final clue/twist: The TV news tape shows Harold closing his eyes
before the Rolls-Royce exploded, thus proving that he knew there was a bomb
under the car. Columbo discovers that Harold's alarm was set to 8 pm, not 8
am. Harold had spent the entire night at a casino, where he won $5,000 and had
breakfast; then he had a haircut and went to Dolores's house, which Columbo
proves with recently cut hairs found inside Harold's hat that was in Dolores'
den. Dolores shot Harold and moved his body to his cabin, but left Harold's
hat at her house. Before Harold planted the bomb, Dolores moved the Rolls-
Royce onto the driveway so the gardener could not drive his truck in. Dolores
then sent the gardener to the back of house so that he would not see her steal
his truck and run Big Fred over. Harold suspected Dolores was involved and was
implying blackmail when he asked her for money. When Dolores demands that
Columbo prove it, he replies, "I don't have to prove it, ma'am. One in the
hand is better than two in the bush," and arrests her for Harold's murder.
Like "Last Salute to the Commodore" many years earlier, the real killer is not
revealed until nearly the end of the episode. In both episodes, murders occur
off screen, and both were scripted by Columbo veteran Jackson Gillis (this was
his final contribution to the series). The episode used footage of a
Saskatchewan Roughriders vs Edmonton Eskimos CFL game to represent fictional
American football teams with the same initials, the Stallions and the Elks.
Coincidentally, in 2021 the real-life Eskimos changed their name and became
the Elks.

This is one of four episodes (the other three being "Undercover", "Last Salute
to the Commodore", and Season 2's "The Most Dangerous Match") in which Columbo
is present at the death of a victim.

actual murder by shooting him and then fleeing. Lisa stays behind in the

until Lauren returns to the complex and begins talking with the building

antique chair similar to the one that Lauren had posed with in another
photograph he had also seen. Upon comparing the two photos side-by-side, he
concludes that it was the same chair, and same location, in both photos,
indicating to him that Lisa and Lauren might actually know each other. He
brings Lisa in for questioning and has Lauren watch behind a one-way mirror.
As it turns out, Lisa is Lauren's daughter, and when Lauren sees Lisa being
loudly interrogated by Columbo's associates, Lauren breaks down and offers to
confess on the condition that Columbo let Lisa go. Lauren admits to the
murder, but refuses to name Lisa as her accomplice. When Columbo learns that
Lauren's motive was to avenge Nick's cheating as well as his physically
attacking Lisa with a razor, Columbo rips up the photo evidence implicating
Lisa, deciding not to charge the daughter as she heads back to Rome. This is
one of two episodes (the other being "Forgotten Lady") in which Columbo allows
a murderer to go unpunished.

Dunaway won an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for her
performance. This is the only episode written by Falk. Aired under ABC Sunday
Night Movie.

Directed by: Vincent McEveety. Story by: Peter Falk.

Butterfly in Shades of Grey

:: Date

:: Description
Domineering radio host Fielding Chase (William Shatner) faces a crisis when
his ward, 25-year-old Victoria Chase (Molly Hagan), decides to spread her
wings and leave for New York. Chase is a national celebrity thanks to his
call-in radio show and while Victoria works as his producer, his affection for
her runs deep. An ex-employee, the homosexual Gerry Winters (Jack Laufer), has
been encouraging Victoria and has even found a literary agent for her book.
Chase decides to kill Winters. He first instructs Winters to call him at a
certain time. Exactly at that appointed hour, Chase drives to Winters's house
and sneaks inside. Winters makes the phone call, unaware that Chase is
actually behind him in the same room. Once the phone goes to Chase's answering
machine, Chase picks up an extension in another room of Winters' house and
begins speaking with him. At that point, Chase enters the next room and shoots
Winters, then makes it look like Winters was shot by a gay lover. Final
clue/twist: A cell phone is a key to Columbo's solution of the crime. Chase
claimed that after hearing the murder on his phone at his mountain home, he
started to drive to Winters's house, then quickly realized he should call 911
and used his cell phone. But, Columbo realizes, there is no cell coverage on
the part of the mountain road near Chase's house, where his car would have
been.

After three unconventional episodes, Butterfly in Shades of Grey marked a
return to the standard Columbo style.

Undercover

:: Date
1994-05-02

:: Description
Irving Krutch (Ed Begley, Jr.), a crooked insurance investigator, enlists the
help of Columbo to solve a series of murders that starts when two men, each of
whom possesses a piece of a photograph, kill each other in a burglary gone
wrong. Some years back a group of four men robbed a bank, but all of them were
killed by the police in a shootout after they were caught in a car accident.
But before they died, they hid their loot somewhere which can only be found
through the assembled photograph. Columbo must go undercover to recover some
of the pieces, solve some murders to get some others, and all the while trying
to figure out what Krutch might be after. Burt Young has a cameo as a small
time hood and Columbo does comic relief in the roles of a mob wise guy and a
gang boss.

This episode is based upon the 87th Precinct novel Jigsaw by Ed McBain,
although not credited as such. This installment thus departs from the usual
format by not revealing the culprit until the end of the show. Unlike the
previous episode based on McBain source material, No Time To Die, this
features a regular character from the 87th Precinct series, Arthur Brown,
played by Harrison Page.

Directed by: Vincent McEveety. Story by: Ed McBain;, Gerry Day.

Strange Bedfellows

:: Date
1995-05-08

:: Description
Graham McVeigh (George Wendt) is a thoroughbred ranch owner, and he is tired
of his brother Teddy being in constant debt to mob bookie and restaurateur
Bruno Romano. He decides to kill Teddy and frame Romano for the crime. To do
so, Graham makes Teddy take a big loss at the race track by drugging his own
horse so that it loses, leaving Teddy in deeper debt to Romano. Graham then
disguises himself and goes to Romano's restaurant, where he sets mice loose in
a bathroom. While Romano is distracted setting traps for the mice, Graham
calls Teddy from a restaurant phone so that the phone records will suggest
Romano called to set up a meeting. Graham and Teddy then drive out to a
secluded section of road. Under the pretense of getting fresh air, Graham gets
out, walks around the car, steps up to Teddy's window and shoots him, then
rides home on a folding bike he stashed in the trunk. The next day, Graham
invites Romano to come out to the ranch, ostensibly to pay Teddy's debt. When
Romano looks at a briefcase containing the money, Graham shoots him, switches
Romano's revolver for the identical murder gun, and makes it look like self-
defense. Romano's boss Vincenzo Fortelli (Rod Steiger) becomes involved,
exerting pressure on McVeigh. To solve the crime before Fortelli takes matters
into his own hands, Columbo must work with the gangster.

Final clue/twist: Columbo invites McVeigh to dinner at Romano's restaurant.
McVeigh accepts the invitation, but Columbo does not turn up. After the last
dinner guests leave, McVeigh quickly suspects that it is a set-up and that
Fortelli and his men are planning an ambush. Fearing for his life, McVeigh
contacts Columbo who says that he never invited him to the restaurant but
quickly makes his way there. After Columbo arrives, Fortelli threatens to kill
McVeigh unless he confesses to murdering Teddy. McVeigh denies it at first,
but fearing for his life even more, he eventually gives in and confesses to
the murder. He also reveals where he hid the gun and Columbo has two officers
quickly locate it. After McVeigh is arrested, Columbo reveals that the whole
confrontation was staged to get McVeigh to confess and Fortelli is impressed -
as he and Columbo had both planned the set-up.

A Trace of Murder

:: Date
1997-05-15

:: Description
Cathleen Calvert (Falk's wife Shera Danese, in her sixth and final appearance)
and her lover, crime scene investigator Patrick Kinsley (David Rasche), are
weary of having to see each other on the sly. She will not divorce her
husband, rich businessman Clifford Calvert (Barry Corbin), due to their
prenuptial agreement. So the lovers scheme to get him out of the way by
killing Howard Seltzer (Raye Birk), an investment broker who is suing him,
then framing Clifford for the murder. To do so, Patrick drives to Seltzer's
house and tricks Seltzer into letting him inside by claiming that his car
phone has died and that he has to make an urgent phone call. Patrick then
shoots Seltzer and plants evidence to suggest that Clifford was responsible.
Columbo's work is cut out for him, because Patrick is on the team handling the
investigation. In this episode it is implied that Columbo only has one eye as
of course Peter Falk has. Final clue/twist: At a restaurant, Columbo sees
Kingsley move the artificial sweetener towards Cathleen Calvert when they all
receive coffee. A few minute later, Columbo sees Kinsley open the front door
of a car for Cathleen Calvert instead of the back door. Columbo realizes that
despite their claims otherwise, the two knew each other. If they had never
met, as they claimed to Columbo, Kinsley would not have known that Cathleen
prefers the front seat because she easily gets car sick when sitting in the
back, or that she takes artificial sweetener with her coffee. A wedding
photographer's shot of the Calvert couple dancing also helps reveal that the
cat hair found on Clifford's suit jacket was planted by Cathleen, while an
earlier photograph shows that Clifford did not have cat hair on his suit
jacket prior to dancing with Cathleen.

Billed as the "25th Anniversary Movie", it aired under ABC Thursday Night
Movie.

Ashes to Ashes

:: Date
1998-10-08

:: Description
Patrick McGoohan stars in and directs his final appearance, his fourth time
playing the murderer. As funeral director to the stars Eric Prince, he murders
gossip columnist Verity Chandler (Rue McClanahan) when she attends his latest
funeral, that of actor and war hero Chuck Houston. Chandler threatens Prince
that her next exposé will be about him. (Two decades earlier, he stole a
valuable diamond from the body of a deceased silent film star.) Prince
bludgeons Chandler with a tool in his storage room, then hides the body in a
compartment used for corpses. After the funeral, Prince takes the casket
containing Houston's body to the preparation room, where he puts Chandler's
body into the casket in its place. It next enters the cremation oven, and
afterwards, the ashes are scattered by helicopter over the Hollywood hills.
Prince then goes to Chandler's house and fakes evidence of her abduction. So
that no one will become suspicious, he cremates Houston's body by piggybacking
him onto another corpse scheduled to be cremated. Final clue/twist: Houston
suffered a war injury in which a distinctively-shaped piece of shrapnel
remained stuck in his body for the rest of his life. It was made of a strong
metal that was not affected by the flames of the cremation process. As Columbo
said when confronting Prince, "Perhaps you can explain how a piece of Mr.
Houston's 50-year-old war record ended up in the urn of a leisurewear
importer."

Sally Kellerman plays the dead man's widow, Liz Houston, and Catherine
McGoohan, the real-life daughter of Patrick McGoohan, plays Rita, Prince's
assistant.

Murder with Too Many Notes

:: Date
2001-03-12

:: Description
Hollywood film composer and conductor Findlay Crawford (Billy Connolly) has
been mentor to a talented young composer, Gabriel McEnery (Chad Willett), who
has been ghostwriting most of Crawford's work for the last few years. Gabe
even penned Crawford's last movie score, which won an Oscar. Crawford realizes
he will be ruined and ridiculed if it ever becomes known. Aware that Gabe
practices on the roof of a studio building, Crawford plots his murder. He
promises Gabe will get to conduct the orchestra during a concert based on
Crawford's "own" movie scores. While giving a toast, Crawford drugs Gabe, then
takes his body up to his rooftop rehearsal place, which happens to be atop a
trapdoor to a freight elevator. He makes it look like Gabe was there
rehearsing; With the concert about to begin, Crawford starts the freight
elevator, then makes it into the concert hall in time to begin conducting
before the elevator reaches the top. When the elevator doors open, Gabe's
unconscious body is pushed over the side and falls to his death, landing in
front of a late-arriving couple. Final clue/twist: Columbo's first clue is
that the victim did not cry out as he fell to his death: On the victim’s body,
Columbo finds a cut on his hand in which dried blood reveals the presence of
secobarbital, explaining why the victim did not scream as he fell to his
death; he was unconscious. This explains why his shoes were two sizes too
large and why his house key was missing: the victim couldn’t complain because
he was unconscious. In Columbo's reconstruction of the Crime clues point to
Crawford as the killer. Crawford confirmed just before that McEnery would have
heard the elevator that threw him off the roof if he wasn’t unconscious. Aired
under Monday Night Movie.

Originally produced in 1999, but left unaired until 2001.

Directed by: Patrick McGoohan. Story by: Patrick McGoohan;, Jeffrey Cava.

Columbo Likes the Nightlife

:: Date

:: Description
When Vanessa Farrow (Jennifer Sky) defends herself against an assault by her
ex-husband, mobster Tony Galper, she accidentally kills him. Her boyfriend,
Los Angeles rave promoter Justin Price (Matthew Rhys), whose new club Galper
was backing, helps Vanessa dispose of the body, but the events are secretly
photographed by tabloid photographer Linwood Coben, who offers Price the
negatives and prints for $250,000. Price agrees to pay, but when they meet,
Price kills him and makes it look like a suicide. Final clue/twist: Columbo
points out that one of the koi tanks built into the dance floor at Price's
club contains fewer fish and must be less deep than the other tanks. Columbo
has ground-penetrating radar used to find Tony's body hidden under the tank.
In the last line of the series, Columbo remarks to a galper "enforcer" that
"Tony was sleeping with the fishes." {Homage to "the Godfather" movie series)
(The club scenes use two tracks from the album Tweekend by The Crystal
Method.) NOTE: As a testament to the longevity of the series, the actors who
played the killers (Rhys and Sky) were not born yet during the first few
seasons of Columbo and Sky herself was only 12 when the series resumed in
February 1989.

This was the final episode of Columbo. It aired under ABC Thursday Night at
the Movies.
