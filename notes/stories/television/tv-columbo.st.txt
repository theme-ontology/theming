:: Choice Themes
how to murder someone and get away with it [Psychiatrist Dr. Ray Flemming murdered his wife with the help of his mistress and made it look as if the victim had been strangled by a burglar. He would have gotten away with her crime had it not been for the meddlesome Lt. Columbo.]
spouse murder [Psychiatrist Dr. Ray Flemming murdered his wife with the help of his mistress and made it look as if the victim had been strangled by a burglar. He would have gotten away with her crime had it not been for the meddlesome Lt. Columbo.]

:: Major Themes
medical occupation [The villain of the story Dr. Ray Flemming was a psychiatrist. He was shown practicing his craft at his clinic. He indulged Columbo by psychoanalyzing a hypothetical murderer, i.e., himself.]
husband and wife [Ray and Carol Flemming. The story turns on Ray strangling Carol to death so that he could be together with his mistress, Joan, without going through a scandal mired and financially ruinous divorce. The story opens with Ray and Carol celebrating their 10th wedding anniversary at home in the company of many friends. Columbo shared some anecdotes about his own wife: she considers him to be forgetful, the pair were thinking of taking a vacation, and she'd prefer he smoke a pipe over those smelly cigars.]
extramarital affair [The story turns on Ray offing his wife ostensibly to be with his young, ginger haired mistress, Joan.]
man and mistress [The story turns on Ray offing his wife ostensibly to be with his young, ginger haired mistress, Joan.]
romantic love [The story turns on Ray offing his wife ostensibly to be with his young, ginger haired mistress, Joan.]
law enforcement [It was up to the sharp-witted, but shabbily dressed homicide detective Lt. Columbo to prove that the psychiatrist Dr. Ray Flemming had strangled his wife in cold blood and made it look like she was killed by a burglar.]
appearances can be deceiving [Witnesses and villains alike are caught off guard by Lieutenant Columbo's bumbling façade, which invariably proves to conceal a laser-focused mind. Ray psychoanalyzed Columbo thusly: "You never stop do you? The insinuation, the change of pace. You're a bag of tricks, Columbo, right down to that prop cigar you use. I'm going to tell you something about yourself: You say you need a psychiatrist; maybe you do and maybe you don't. But you are the textbook example of compensation... adaptability. You're an intelligent man, Columbo, but you hide it. You pretend you're something you are not. Why? Because of your appearance. You think you cannot get by on looks or polish, so you turn a defect into a virtue. You take people by surprise. They underestimate you, and that's where you trip them up. Like coming here tonight."]
pride goes before a fall [A recurring motif was Dr. Flemming's self-assured conviction that, thanks to his immense intellect, there was no conceivable way a mere police investigator could find him out. Lt. Columbo later pointed out that while Dr. Flemming might indeed outgun him in the brainpower department, Lt. Columbo's lengthy experience with murders counted for a lot more.]

:: Minor Themes
divorce [Carol informed Ray she'd be calling her lawyers in morning about filing for divorce when he came home after stepping out from their wedding anniversary party to see his mistress. She changed her mind after falling for Ray's lies.]
gold digging [Carol and Ray half-joked that he married her for her father's money.]
the inclination to believe what one wants to believe [A disguised Joan doubted that she would pass for Ray's wife, Carol. Ray, however, assuaged her anxiety by citing the so-called "Principle of Association", which he summed up as something to the effect of "people see what they expect to see, and not what is really there".]
burglary [Ray staged a burglary of his own home as part of a calculated plot to off his wife.]
beating one's self up [Ray theatrically feigned to blame himself for his wife's plight.]
funeral rite [A funeral was held for Carol.]
acting [Joan spoke of her acting career. She was costumed as an Ancient Greco-Roman woman at the studio.]
suicide [Columbo staged Joan's suicide.]
coping with a loved one being in peril [Dr. Flemming feigned distress after he got the news that his wife was in a coma-like state following a murder attempt.]
romantic jealousy [Carol became jealous when she thought, correctly as it were, that Ray had been seeing his mistress again.]
humans interacting [Ray and Carol Flemming celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary in the company of friends at home.]

Murder by the Book

:: Date
1971-09-15

:: Description
Ken Franklin is one-half of a mystery writing team, but partner Jim Ferris
wants to go solo, exposing the fact that Ferris did all the actual writing,
and thus leave the high-living Franklin without his cash cow. However, the
pair have an insurance policy on which Franklin can collect if Ferris dies
during the partnership. Franklin makes it look like Ferris was investigating
gangsters. He tricks Ferris into taking a trip to Franklin's remote cabin two
hours away. They stop at a general store, where, as Franklin makes a phone
call to Ferris's wife to establish an alibi, the owner Lilly La
Sanka—obviously smitten with Franklin—peers outside to see whom Franklin
brought with him and sees Ferris in the passenger seat of the car. At the
cabin, Franklin convinces Ferris to call his wife and tell her he's working
late at the office. During the phone call, Franklin shoots Ferris. He drives
two hours back to his house with his dead partner in the trunk, dumping the
corpse on his own lawn. La Sanka tracks Franklin to Los Angeles when he is out
on a date and loudly approaches him, making it clear that she knows Franklin
killed Ferris, forcing him to cancel his date. He brings her the $15,000 she
wants for her silence, feigning interest in her. The two have an intimate
dinner in the back of her store, then he bludgeons her and puts her body in a
boat, which he capsizes to make her death appear accidental.

Final clue/twist: After hearing that Ferris habitually wrote down ideas for
his mystery novels on whatever paper was handy, Columbo searches his office
and house and finds a note with the fake phone call/alibi scheme. He confronts
Franklin with it, and Franklin confesses. Upon his arrest, Franklin makes a
startling comment: the alibi idea was in fact his, the only good one he ever
had. Note: In 1997 TV Guide ranked this episode number 16 on its '100 Greatest
Episodes of All Time' list.

The Mrs. Melville novel that is frequently seen in the episode is named
"Prescription: Murder", the same name as Columbo's first pilot episode.

attitude of superiority [Ken Franklin patronizing explained to Columbo how he should go about solving the murder mystery. He later spoke arrogantly about his luxurious lifestyle.]

Death Lends a Hand

:: Date
1971-10-06

:: Description
Carl Brimmer, the very tough, hard-nosed head of a private detective agency,
with unfortunate and fateful anger issues, is hired by Arthur Kennicut, a
powerful publishing magnate who suspects his wife, Lenore, of infidelity.
Although Brimmer indeed finds evidence of her being unfaithful, instead of
reporting this fact to his client, he attempts to blackmail Lenore into
obtaining business and political secrets from her husband. She refuses and
tells him she will expose his plot to her husband, at which point Brimmer
accidentally kills her in a fit of rage. He dumps her body at a scrapyard and
later joins the investigation into Lenore's death with Columbo. Brimmer
secretly starts to divert suspicion away from himself and even offers Columbo
a job.

Final clue/twist: Columbo becomes suspicious when he realizes a cut on the
victim's face matches Brimmer's ring. He disables Brimmer's car, causing the
vehicle to be garaged for repair. He has Lenore's body exhumed, then claims
that one of her contact lenses was not with the body and is missing. He tells
Brimmer the lens must be either at the crime scene or in the car the murderer
used to transport the body. After searching for it in his home, Brimmer goes
to the garage after-hours and searches for it in the trunk of his car. He
finds a contact lens, but is caught by Columbo, with Kennicut in tow. When
Brimmer tries to throw the lens away the police stop him, and he confesses.
After Brimmer is led away Columbo admits to Kennicut he had arranged
everything, and that there never was a missing contact lens. Notes: This
episode won an Emmy for writing and is known for the "glasses effect" after
Brimmer kills Lenore, in which both lenses of Brimmer's glasses simultaneously
show different images on-screen of him cleaning the scene of the crime.

Brimmer is the first of a small number of Columbo killers who appear
sympathetic after Columbo catches them as Brimmer apologetically tells
Kennicut that the killing was an accident and that he didn't want to hurt
either one of them.

Major General Martin Hollister, a retired Marine Corps war hero, learns he is
being investigated for embezzling military funds, then shoots his skittish
accomplice, Col. Dutton. The act is partially witnessed by Helen Stewart, who
was in a passing boat. She is wooed by Hollister into doubting her own story.

Final clue/twist: After an encounter with his nostalgia-crazy cook, Columbo
realizes that Hollister would never have let go of his signature revolver, the
assumed murder weapon. Columbo retrieves the weapon, which Hollister claimed
was a replica made for his museum display, and the police forensic unit
identifies it as the weapon that killed Dutton. Hollister, with his
extraordinary self-confidence, had assumed that everyone would accept what he
said about the exhibit's weapon being merely a replica.

Art critic Dale Kingston murders his uncle and tries to frame his aunt to
inherit his uncle's very valuable art collection. He later murders his lover
and accomplice in the crime, the gullible art student, Tracy.

Final clue/twist: Kingston hides the paintings that he stole after the murder
in his aunt's house to frame her, then arranges for the police to find them.
Columbo, arriving late on the scene, accuses Kingston of the murder and says
he can prove it with fingerprints. Kingston replies that his fingerprints
being all over the paintings prove nothing. Columbo retorts that it is his own
fingerprints that prove the case, from when he touched the paintings early in
the investigation, when he visited Kingston in his home. Shaken, Kingston
insists that Columbo must have touched the paintings moments ago, to frame
him. Columbo takes his hands out of his pockets to show that he has been
wearing gloves the whole time.

Lady in Waiting

1971-12-15

:: Description
Beth Chadwick murders her domineering older brother, Bryce, after he attempts
to break up her relationship with one of his executives, Peter Hamilton, a man
he thinks is only interested in Beth for ulterior motives. His mailing a
letter threatening to terminate Peter's employment if he didn't break things
off with Beth causes her to reach the tipping point and to act to gain control
of her own life and, it turns out, the family business (as there are no other
siblings). Complications in Beth's plan contribute to Columbo's suspicions.
Beth had planned to claim the shooting was an accident. She removed his house
key from his key chain thinking it would require him, late at night, to try to
enter the house via her bedroom. However, Bryce had a spare key which he had
hidden under a flowerpot thus entering the house without ado. She improvises
as best she can but her story will ultimately be undermined as a result of
this turn of events. Meanwhile, her true personality emerges, showing a very
different side than that shown earlier, before the murder.

Final clue/twist: When Columbo re-reads the testimony of Peter Hamilton, who
had driven to the house after receiving the letter from Bryce, he notices that
Hamilton climbed over the gates and heard the gunshots before the alarm went
off, not after. The detail is enough to undo her entire story. Columbo tells
Beth that Hamilton won't like doing it, but he will testify to what he knows.

Then she'd shoot him and pretend that she'd done so in a delirium after just waking up and mistaking him for a burglar.

conditions rather than Roger's bomb. Columbo shows Roger a damaged but intact
box of cigars and tells him it came from the death scene. Along with Everett,
they take a cable car up the mountain. Roger, thinking they are the booby-
trapped cigars he had planted, becomes unhinged. He screams at Columbo to get
rid of the box because it is about to explode. Columbo reveals that the box is
not from the death scene, that he had just got it and scuffed it up to look
like it had been. Realizing he has been tricked, Roger can only laugh
hysterically.

Blueprint for Murder

:: Date
1972-02-09

:: Description
Elliot Markham is an architect with a vision for a city of the future, and a
penchant for classical music. His latest project is being bankrolled by the
young wife of Bo Williamson, a wealthy industrialist who has been away on a
lengthy overseas business trip. When Williamson returns and finds out how his
money is being spent, he is furious, and intends to cut off the funds. Markham
decides that the only way he can continue his work is to eliminate Williamson.
Simply killing him, however, poses a problem, because his money reverts to a
trust fund when he dies. Markham comes up with a clever plan to conceal the
body and make it appear as if Beau has gone on another long foreign trip.

Final clue/twist: Markham repeatedly goads Columbo into excavating a building
site to search for Williamson's body, until Columbo finally does so. It yields
nothing. Later that night Markham returns to that site with the body, assuming
no-one would ever look there again. However Columbo has known what Markham has
been up to all along, he emerges from the shadows with other policemen and
arrests Markham. Columbo reveals that he knew something had happened to
Williamson when he checked his car and found the radio turned to a classical
music station, something odd for Williamson, who only listened to country
music.

Alex Benedict, the married conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra
who resembles the famous conductor Leonard Bernstein, murders his mistress,
Jennifer Welles, after she insists on going public with their affair, and
tries to make it look like a suicide. Columbo searches for clues to place
Benedict at the murder scene.

Final clue/twist: During the murder, Benedict loses his signature boutonnière.
While conducting that night's concert he realizes its loss and goes back to
the now police-crowded crime scene. He recovers the flower and puts it back
on. A TV news team records him leaving the house with it, while the recording
of the earlier concert shows him being without it. Columbo insists this proves
that Benedict must have been there the night of the murder. Witnessing their
confrontation, Benedict's wife refuses to support his alibi. Note: It is
highly unlikely the District Attorney would take the case to trial with such

The Greenhouse Jungle

:: Date
1972-10-15

:: Description
Jarvis Goodland and his nephew, Tony, stage Tony's kidnapping in order to
break into his trust fund and use his half to hold on to his wife, to whom he
wishes to remain married, despite her expensive tastes and separate social and
romantic life. Jarvis, disgusted at the notion, shoots and kills Tony, whom he
has always despised, once the ransom is paid, and a careful swapping of guns
with Tony's wife casts suspicion in her direction.

Final clue/twist: After Columbo remembers that Jarvis Goodland had years
earlier fired a gun at a burglar but only managed to hit a flowerpot, Columbo
searches the greenhouse with a metal detector for the old slug. It turns out
to be identical to the bullet with which Tony was murdered, proving Goodland
killed his nephew, and that the gun evidence against Tony's wife was part of a
frame-up.

This episode marks the first appearance of Bob Dishy as Columbo's newly
assigned and totally unwanted neophyte partner, Sergeant Frederick Wilson,
full of the latest techniques from Berkeley. He appears again in Now You See
Him... (Season 5, Episode 5). It is also the first episode in which the main
crime is committed after Columbo's initial appearance.

The Most Crucial Game

:: Date
1972-11-05

:: Description
Paul Hanlon, the general manager of the Los Angeles Rockets football team,
wants to create a sports empire, but Eric Wagner, who inherited the team,
lacks ambition. Hanlon sneaks out of the stadium during the national anthem by
disguising himself as an ice cream truck driver. He drives to a pay phone near
Wagner's home, knowing Wagner's phones have been bugged, during which Hanlon
makes it appear he's in his private box at the stadium by holding a radio to
the receiver. He then drives to Wagner's house, bludgeons him with a blow to
the head with a heavy piece of ice, which melts in the swimming pool, to make
it appear to be an accident. Complicating matters is Eve Babcock, ostensibly a
secretary but actually a call girl and an operative placed in Eric's home by a
private detective who was, in turn, hired by Eric's attorney, Walter Cannell.
James Gregory plays the football team’s coach.

Final clue/twist: Columbo notices that the tape of the phone call Hanlon made
to establish his alibi, which Hanlon insists was made from his private box in
the stadium, did not capture the sound made whenever Hanlon’s office clock
chimes to signal the bottom of the hour (the half hour). It proves that
Hanlon’s phone call was not made from his private box.

Dagger of the Mind

1972-11-26

:: Description
When Sir Roger Haversham realizes that actors Nicholas Frame and his wife,
Lillian Stanhope, have manipulated him into backing their theater production,
he confronts the couple, and is accidentally killed during the ensuing
scuffle. The pair cover up the killing by stuffing the body into a trunk,
taking it home to his estate, and staging an apparent fall down the stairs.
Columbo is visiting London to study British police techniques as the guest of
Scotland Yard Detective Chief Superintendent William Durk, who is called to
investigate the incident. Miss Dudley, an attractive young understudy Frame
has his eye on, is intensely disliked by Stanhope. Haversham's butler covers
for the couple but later tries to blackmail them and is murdered by Frame. The
theater doorman comes into possession of the dead man's umbrella, which
becomes vital to the resolution of the case.

Final clue/twist: Columbo engineers a situation whereby, before witnesses,
they search the dead man’s closed umbrella, on exhibit in a wax museum, for a
pearl from Lillian Stanhope's broken necklace. According to Columbo this could
only have gotten there during the killing. When the umbrella is opened and a
pearl is revealed, the increasingly unstable Frame starts babbling, and
Stanhope, now overwhelmed, confesses to how they killed Sir Roger. (Columbo
had, however, used his childhood marble-playing skills to shoot the pearl into
the umbrella moments before it was opened.)

The first of several episodes to feature locations outside the United States,
it was filmed in both London and Hollywood. Although scenes with Wilfrid Hyde-
White were set in London, due to the actor's tax problems all his character's
scenes were filmed in California.

Requiem for a Falling Star

:: Date
1973-01-21

:: Description
Jean Davis, personal assistant to aging movie star Nora Chandler, is engaged
to gossip reporter Jerry Parks, and she has secret information about Chandler.
Nora deflates the tire of Jean's car so that the engaged couple will have to
switch vehicles. Chandler starts a gasoline fire just as Parks's car (being
driven by Davis) pulls into his garage. It initially appears that the
murderer's intended victim was Parks, but actually Jean was the target.
Columbo solves the case after connecting it to the mysterious disappearance of
Chandler's husband a decade earlier.

Final clue/twist: Columbo is not sure of anything. He watches one of Nora's
old movies in which she disguised herself as a man to commit a murder. He
remembers some facts about the disappearance of her husband years before, that
the fountain in Nora's garden does not work, and learns it was purchased the
day after her husband disappeared. He tricks Nora into thinking her husband's
body might have been discovered. When she rushes home and runs straight to her
garden, Columbo, lying in wait, confronts her. She confesses that she killed
her husband and buried his body under the fountain, and that Jean knew it and
that is why she killed her.

A Stitch in Crime

:: Description
Cardiac surgeon Dr. Barry Mayfield and Dr. Edmund Hiedemann have pioneered a
major medical breakthrough that Mayfield wants to publish about immediately,
but Hiedemann wants to wait and do more tests. When Dr. Hiedemann's heart
condition worsens, requiring the insertion of a heart valve, Mayfield performs
the surgery using non-permanent sutures, that will kill his partner when it
dissolves in his body. Nurse Sharon Martin, a friend of Hiedemann, who has
never trusted or liked Mayfield, uncovers a suspicious piece of suture, which
she takes with her from the operating room. Mayfield observes her doing this
and later kills Martin in the hospital garage parking area, staging it as an
apparent mugging. He later tries to pin the crime on her ex-boyfriend, a
former drug addict, whom he kills as well. This episode contains one of the
rare occasions when Columbo loses (or appears to lose) his temper; suddenly
slamming a coffee pot down onto Mayfield's desk he angrily warns him that if
Hiedemann dies, the police will have his body autopsied to check what sutures
were used in his operation.

Final clue/twist: Mayfield operates on Heidemann again, ostensibly for medical
reasons but actually to replace the dissolving sutures. As soon as the
procedure is completed, police swarm the operating suite and search for the
removed sutures. Mayfield loses his composure, demanding to be allowed to
leave the operating room and shoving Columbo in the process. Just as it seems
that no sutures are to be found and that Mayfield is in the clear, Columbo re-
enters the doctor's office and reveals that he was puzzled as to why Mayfield,
always so calm and collected, would have shoved him, then realized that
Mayfield used the scuffle to rid himself of the sutures. Here, Columbo pulls
the sutures from the pocket of the surgical scrubs he, Columbo himself, had
worn in the operating room - "the only thing not searched". The hitherto
impassive Mayfield shows the first signs of distress. Nita Talbot plays
Marsha, Sharon Martin's roommate.

Apart from season 10's "No Time to Die", which had no murderer and is a vast
divergence from the series formula, this is the only Columbo episode in which
a murderer fails to kill his intended target.

how to murder someone and get away with it [Heart surgeon Dr. Barry Mayfield found himself presented with an opportunity to ingeniously get rid of one his senior colleagues that was standing in the way of his career: Dr. Mayfield was called on to perform heart surgery on said colleague. While doing so, he clandestinely replaced the normal sutures to be used with dissolving sutures dyed to look the same. These would have dissolved a few days later and the patient would have died of heart failure that would have been hard to pin on anyone. He would surely have gotten away with it had it not been for the timely intervention of Lieutenant Columbo. Dr. Mayfield also murdered a hospital nurse and a recovered drug addict to cover his tracks.]

boss and employee [Nurse Sharon was stuck in an awkward situation when she began suspecting that Dr. Barry might be trying to botch his surgery on Dr. Edmund.]
medical risk taking [The research colleagues Dr. Mayfield and Dr. Hiedemann were at odds over whether to announce their apparent medical breakthrough immediately or wait for the results of more tests. Dr. Mayfield was eager to publish their result. The elder partner, Dr. Hiedemann, had a more cautious attitude, and insisted on performing some additional tests. Dr. Mayfield resorted to an elaborate attempt on Dr. Hiedemann's life in a bid to get his way.]

The Most Dangerous Match

:: Date
1973-03-04

:: Description
When Chess Grandmaster Emmett Clayton loses an impromptu game to Eastern
European champion Tomlin Dudek the night before their championship match,
Clayton decides to kill Dudek. The hearing impaired Clayton shoves him into a
garbage grinder in the basement. Dudek survives so Clayton poisons his rival
in the hospital before he can regain consciousness. Heidi Brühl plays Linda
Robinson, who follows in her mother's footsteps in looking after Dudek. Lloyd
Bochner plays Dudek's accompanying coach, Mazoor Berozski.

Final clue/twist: Columbo learns that Dudek's injuries were caused by the fall
into the grinder rather than by the grinder itself, and that the machinery
automatically shuts off if something falls into it while it is in operation.
Realizing that someone wanting to kill Dudek would merely have had to turn the
grinder back on after it shut itself off, Columbo concludes that since it was
not turned back on it means Dudek’s attacker did not know the grinder had shut
itself off. This in turn means the culprit must be deaf.

This is one of two episodes (the other is season 10's "A Bird in the Hand...")
in which Columbo himself is present at a victim's death.

how to murder someone and get away with it [Emmett Clayton realized he was about to loose to Tomlin Dudek in a fated chess game and therefore tried to dispose of his rival in the following seemingly clever way: He would trick Tomlin into writing a farewell note in his native language then push him into a garbage grinder in the basement. Alas, being deaf he failed to notice that the garbage grinder did not start. Even so he might have gotten away with it had it not been for the ever-pesky Lieutenant Columbo.]

tabletop games [The story concerns a chess master who murders his opponent the night before their high profile match was scheduled to take place. Columbo was playing checkers with the veterinarian.]

Double Shock

:: Date
1973-03-25

:: Description
Flamboyant television chef Dexter Paris and his identical twin brother,
conservative banker Norman, are supposedly not talking to one another. But
both disapprove that their uncle Clifford Paris has become engaged to young,
beautiful Lisa Chambers. One of the brothers kills uncle Clifford by dropping
an electric mixer into the bathtub while he is bathing, electrocuting him. The
body is moved to the gym to make it seem like he had a heart attack while
using an exercise bike. Clifford's lawyer, Michael Hathaway reveals to the
twins that a new will exists, one which he is willing to "lose" for a price.
However, Chambers, who became fearful when Columbo questioned her, also has a
copy of the will, and thus she is murdered too. Unlike most Columbo episodes,
this has a whodunit element which is not resolved until the end of the
episode. Dabney Coleman plays Columbo's colleague, Detective Murray. Jeanette
Nolan plays Mrs. Peck, a sharp-tongued, fastidious, loyal housekeeper who is
appalled by the "terrible mess" Columbo makes in the house.

Final clue/twist: The audience has seen one of the twin brothers commit the
murder, but does not know which one. During much of the episode both twins try
to convince Columbo the other is the killer. Columbo eventually establishes
that two persons must have been involved in the actual murder. Due to the
short time frame between the short circuit caused by the electrocution and the
re-powering of the house, and due to the physical exertion required to drag
the dead body out of the bathtub and prop it up on a stationary bike, he
realizes the brothers must have worked together. When confronted, Norman
admits to what they did, while Dexter screams at him to shut up.

Lovely but Lethal

:: Description
Cosmetics queen Viveca Scott has developed a seemingly magic wrinkle remover,
but her former lover, Karl Lessing, a chemist for her company, knows the
formula and intends to sell it to Scott's rival, David Lang. Lessing refuses
to sell it back to her at any price, and when he taunts Scott, she bludgeons
him to death and covers up her tracks as best she can. Lang's secretary,
Shirley Blaine, has been giving information to Scott about his operation, and,
knowing about Lessing's negotiations with Lang, she attempts to blackmail
Scott. So Scott kills her too.

Final clue/twist: Columbo notices Viveca itching and, as he suffers in the
same way, he realizes they both have poison ivy and must have contacted it
from the same source. Scott suspects the wrinkle remover is responsible for
her itching. However, Columbo tells her the poison ivy was actually on the
slide of Lessing's microscope, shards of which they both touched – he while
examining the crime scene, while she could only have done it around the time
that Lessing was killed.

Wine connoisseur Adrian Carsini runs a small winery specializing in
unprofitable but prized wines. He is about to be named the wine industry's
Man-of-the-Year. His half-brother, Rick, only wants to spend money on various
hobbies and interests like sports and fast cars and has also been married
several times. When Rick gets tired of Adrian's indulgences, he announces his
decision to sell the land to mass producers of cheap, profitable wines. Adrian
knocks him unconscious and leaves him to die in an airtight wine cellar. He
travels to New York to accept the award and attend wine auctions, at the same
time establishing his alibi. Upon his return, he concocts a scuba diving
accident to explain Rick's death by suffocation. Julie Harris plays Adrian's
formidable secretary, who realizes that Columbo suspects Carsini of killing
his brother, and has plans of her own for Carsini.

Final clue/twist: Columbo realizes Carsini had locked Rick in the airtight
wine cellar with the air conditioning turned off, and realizes further that
this happened when a heatwave had struck Los Angeles. Columbo steals a very
rare bottle of wine (Ferrier Vintage Port 1945) from Carsini’s cellar, and
when he treats Carsini and his secretary to dinner, arranges for the
restaurant staff to serve it to them. Carsini, upon tasting the wine, explodes
in anger and berates the staff for exposing it to very high temperatures.
Columbo tells Carsini that reminds him of the recent heatwave. Carsini
realizes that all the wine in his cellar would have been spoiled in the
heatwave, so that night he sets out to destroy all the bottles. A heart-broken
Carsini is caught in the act by Columbo and confesses, expressing relief that
at least he does not any more have to deal with his secretary, who had guessed
the truth and was pressuring him to marry her.

Harry Stone, a campaign manager for Nelson Hayward, is coercing the womanizing
senatorial candidate  to end his affair with his wife Vickie's personal
secretary Linda, which Stone regards as too risky during a campaign. Stone is
also the mastermind of a publicity stunt that involves fabricating death
threats against Hayward, to promote his tough stance against crime. Hayward
uses this to his advantage: he lures Stone to his own beach house (while
driving Hayward's car and wearing Hayward's coat), where the candidate shoots
and kills Stone, making it look like a case of mistaken identity at the hands
of the phantom assassins.

Final clue/twist: Hayward, realizing that Columbo is coming closer to solving
the murder, stages a phony assassination attempt on himself. He fires a
silenced gun through a balcony window into his private hotel room. He later
gets rid of the gun. Hours later he returns to the room, ignites a firecracker
to mimic a gunshot, and claims that someone has just shot at him from outside.
When the police express shock at the brazenness of the alleged shooter, he
feigns outrage at them doubting his word, and demands that the bullet be
removed from the wall and analyzed. Columbo reveals that the ballistics of the
bullet are already in, and that it indeed was fired from the murder weapon. He
explains that after Hayward had been alone in the room (a time when he
ostensibly was making phone calls), Columbo had searched it and found the hole
in the window and the bullet in the wall. He had done this hours before
Hayward claimed someone had just shot at him.

Double Exposure

:: Date
1973-12-16

:: Description
Dr. Bart Keppel is a "motivation research specialist" at Impulse Research Labs
who has become an expert practitioner of subliminal advertising (which
involves inserting frames of an advertised product into the reels of a film,
so viewers' subconscious minds react to what is pictured). Keppel's more
lucrative sideline is blackmail: he takes pictures of married clients with
attractive women he hired to get them in compromising positions. When his
latest victim, Vic Norris, refuses to be blackmailed and threatens to expose
him, Keppel plots to kill him. Keppel serves salty caviar at a reception he is
hosting for his clients prior to showing them his latest promotional film.
Subliminal photos of a refreshing drink are inserted into the film, which,
when it is shown, lure Norris out of the screening room. Keppel is supposedly
narrating the film as it is playing, but in reality the clients are hearing
Keppel's voice playing from a tape recorder. When Norris is lured out, Keppel
shoots him in the building lobby. Keppel has already set in motion a scheme to
make it seem that the crime was committed by Norris's wife. Keppel's
projectionist, Roger White, then discovers the cuts in the film and pieces
together Keppel's scheme, forcing Keppel to murder him as well when Roger
tries to blackmail him.

Final clue/twist: Columbo uses Keppel’s technique against him. He arranges to
splice into a film, which Keppel will soon view, many subliminal cuts of
images of Columbo closely searching areas where the murder weapon must be. On
seeing the cuts, an alarmed Keppel rushes to his office to make sure the
weapon is still where he left it. Columbo is waiting there, hidden, and when
Keppel retrieves the evidence, Columbo is there to seize it.

This episode received the Emmy Award in the category for Outstanding Limited

:: Description
Publisher Riley Greenleaf decides to kill his prolific author Alan Mallory,
for the insurance and also to keep him from defecting to another publisher. He
hires ex-con and avid homemade bomb enthusiast Eddie Kane to do the job. While
Greenleaf is getting drunk at a nearby bar, Kane walks into Mallory's office
and shoots him. To cover his tracks, Greenleaf then kills Kane with one of his
own bombs, making it look like an accident. Columbo must discover the link
between the two crimes.

Final clue/twist: Greenleaf hands over an old synopsis to Columbo, claiming it
was Kane’s, which allegedly proves that Kane had the idea for Mallory's latest
book, and murdered him out of revenge for Mallory's having stolen it. Columbo
finds out, however, that the ending of the book was actually developed very
shortly before the murder, by Mallory and his agent, to make sure the book was
more appealing for a Hollywood film adaptation. Kane could not have known the
new ending, so the synopsis must have been done by Greenleaf.

This episode has a split screen of Greenleaf's alibi and Mallory's murder.
Mariette Hartley's role is similar to the one she played in Season 7's "Try
and Catch Me". Spillane was the real-life author of Mike Hammer detective
mysteries. Cassidy played the villain in three Columbo episodes: this one,
Murder by the Book and Now You See Him...

Mind over Mayhem

:: Date
1974-02-10

:: Description
When Dr. Howard Nicholson threatens to expose Neil Cahill for plagiarizing a
paper from a recently deceased scientist, Neil's father, Dr. Marshall Cahill,
director of a high-tech Pentagon think tank, kills Nicholson to protect his
son's reputation. He programs a cybernetic robot codenamed MM-7 to take his
place overseeing a war exercise. The elder Cahill steals a car from the motor
pool and drives to Nicholson's house. In the driveway, Cahill runs over
Nicholson, then carries his body into the house, ransacking it to make it look
like a burglary. To cover up damage the car received from the impact, Cahill
backs his own car into it, with many witnesses to the accident. Nicholson's
wife happens to be Neil's psychotherapist.

Final clue/twist: Columbo realizes early on that Marshall is the likely
murderer after finding a burned match at Nicholson's home (Nicholson's wife
doesn't smoke and Nicholson himself used a pipe lighter; therefore the match
points to a cigar smoker, which Marshall is), but fails to unearth solid
evidence against him. Columbo discovers that Marshall’s motive was based on
his love for his son. Columbo frames and arrests the son, which causes the
father to confess. This episode provides perhaps the most glaring example of
Columbo using ethically dubious means to secure a murderer’s apprehension.

He also made it look like a burglary, and tried to cover his tracks by backing into the borrowed car with his own later on. Thus, covering over the dent made by hitting Dr. Nicholson. He would have undoubtedly gotten away with it not been for the meddlesome Lt. Columbo.]
father and son [Dr. Marshall Cahill was so obsessed with looking out for his son Neil that he committed murder in order to save the son from disgrace. Later he confessed to the crime only in order to save his son from the murder charge. The plot turns on the director of a prestigious research institute, Dr. Marshall Cahill, electing to protect his beloved son, Neil Cahill, from being exposed as a scientific fraud by the simple expedient of murdering Neil's outer, Dr. Nicholson, before he went to the press.]

parental pride [Dr. Marshall Cahill took pride in his son, Neil Cahill, being named Scientist of the Year and resorted to murder to prevent Neil from being outed as a fraud. The elder Cahill said "I'm proud of you" to Neil, and later acknowledged to Columbo that he was proud of his son.]
robot helper [The comically maladroit MM-7 programmable humanoid robot, who the viewer may recognize as Robby the Robot, was programmed to become Dr. Cahill's unwitting accomplice in the murder of Dr. Nicholson. MM-7 carried out tasks at a computer terminal so that it seemed Howard was there. It additionally understood natural language, could walk a dog, and proved to be a particularly sore loser at chess. In addition, Dr. Marshall Cahill programmed the MM-7 to take his place overseeing a war exercise.]

the desire for prestige [Neil Cahill was so eager to become Scientist of the Year that he plagiarized the recently deceased Dr. Finch's "theory of molecular" matter.

:: Description
Gospel-singing superstar Tommy Brown is hugely successful, but he is unable to
enjoy the usual benefits of fame and wealth. His zealous wife Edna can prove
he had committed statutory rape with one of his backup singers, Maryann. She
watches him carefully when he is touring, and even blackmails him into giving
all the proceeds from his concerts to her ministry. Tommy decides to kill Edna
and Maryann. He drugs both women to sleep while piloting a small, private
plane flying to Los Angeles, then parachutes from the plane before it crashes
into desert mountains. Brown lands roughly, hurting his leg. He hides the
parachute and lies down near the burning plane wreckage, making it seem like
he was thrown clear in a tragic crash caused by flying through bad weather.
The FAA investigator is ready to rule the crash was an accident. Edna's
brother, Luke appeals to Columbo to consider the case a possible homicide,
based on his mistrust of Tommy.

Final clue/twist: Columbo’s investigation leads him to conclude that Brown
must have used a home-made parachute to jump from the plane in midair, which
he then hid somewhere in the mountains. Columbo tells Brown that a boy scout
troop will be scouring the mountains for any wreckage from the crash. However,
Brown seems unperturbed. At the airport before Brown is about to fly off to a
concert, Columbo notices Brown taking his car rental keys with him onto the
plane. Because he doesn't return the keys, Columbo concludes that Brown must
be returning to Los Angeles. That night Brown drives up into the mountains and
unearths the parachute, but he is caught bringing it back to the rental car by
Columbo, hiding in wait. A relieved Brown asks Columbo if he's afraid to be
alone with a killer; Columbo plays Brown's songs and says anyone who sings
that well can't be all bad.

A Friend in Deed

:: Date
1974-05-05

:: Description
When Hugh Caldwell accidentally kills his wife during a fight, he calls his
friend and neighbor, LAPD Deputy Commissioner Mark Halperin. Halperin helps
Caldwell cover up the crime, then forces him to assist the following night in
the drowning-murder of Halperin's own wife, a wealthy heiress whose money
Halperin covets. Halperin arranges the situation to make it seem that a cat
burglar, who has recently been active in their neighborhood, is the culprit in
both killings, and orders Columbo to tailor his investigation to that theory.

Final clue/twist: Columbo enlists the burglar's help in trapping the true
murderers. Columbo creates fake files for the "burglary investigation" on
which Halperin had ordered him to concentrate. While perusing the file,
ostensibly to help Columbo, Halperin notes the burglar’s address. He hides
jewelry taken from one of the murder scenes there, and shortly thereafter
leads a raid on that apartment. Columbo confronts Halperin and accuses him of
being involved in the murders. Halperin threatens Columbo’s job, and is
triumphant when the planted jewelry is found in the searched apartment.
However Columbo reveals that he himself is renting the apartment, that the
burglar has no connection to it. Since only Columbo and Halperin knew that
address, Halperin must have planted the jewelry there, which in turns means he
must have been involved in the murders.

The first murder victim, Janice Caldwell, is killed before the episode begins,
and is seen only as a corpse. The actress playing the part is unknown.

An Exercise in Fatality

:: Date
1974-09-15

:: Description
Renowned exercise guru Milo Janus runs a chain of successful gyms. His charm
is not enough to calm the anger of franchise owner Gene Stafford, who has
found out how Janus overcharges his franchises for equipment and supplies,
depositing the profits in offshore bank accounts. When Stafford threatens to
organize other victims of Janus and to go public with a class action suit,
Janus kills him. He makes it look like Stafford was working out, trying to
lift weights too heavy for him, with the result being that the barbell fell
and crushed his windpipe.

Final clue/twist: From the way the shoelaces on the corpse were tied, Columbo
deduces that Stafford did not tie his own sport shoes. Columbo concludes that
the murderer must have put the shoes on Stafford’s feet, when he dressed the
corpse in exercise clothing, and only Janus knew before the discovery of the
body that Stafford was wearing exercise gear. Throughout the episode multiple
hints to the solution are given (including a sustained close-up of the
victim's shoes, Columbo tying his own shoes several times, Columbo discussing
his shoes with other characters, and by a character named "Lacy").

Negative Reaction

:: Date
1974-10-14

:: Description
After years of marriage to his domineering wife, Frances, professional
photographer Paul Galesko decides to kill her. He hires ex-con Alvin Deschler
to rent an isolated ranch house. Galesko persuades his wife to accompany him
there and she grudgingly agrees. He ties her to a chair, photographs the
scene, and then shoots her. He sets things up so it will appear he is
elsewhere when the pictures were taken. Galesko meets Deschler at a junkyard.
After shooting Deschler with a revolver, Galesko shoots himself in the leg
with the pistol used in the first murder, then plants that gun on Deschler so
that it will appear the "kidnapper" was killed in self-defense. JoAnna Cameron
plays Galesko's assistant, with whom he is planning a romantic getaway.

Final clue/twist: Columbo stages a false accusation using a mirror-inverted
version of the kidnapping photo Galesko used to fabricate an alibi. The
reverse negative shows a different time on a clock in the photo, a time for
which Galesko has no alibi. An increasingly riled Galesko accuses Columbo of
framing him with false evidence, and becomes more incensed when Columbo tells
him the original photo was accidentally destroyed. Galesko grabs a camera from
a shelf where there are twelve other cameras, and shows Columbo a negative
that is still inside it. Galesko says the negative proves him right about
which way the clock is pointing in the original photograph. Galesko has thus
given himself away. He had no way of knowing which camera had been used as
part of the kidnapping scheme, or that the negative was still in the back of
that camera. Galesko, defeated, realizes that Columbo had staged the false
arrest with the exact purpose of getting him to lose his cool so he would
rashly identify the camera. The outside set of Deschler's hotel room is the
set of Psycho.

school, is told by the Board of Trustees president William Haynes, with whom
Rumford has a contentious relationship, that due to declining enrollment it
must be converted into a coed school. Haynes also makes clear that Rumford
will no longer be in charge of the revamped institution. Rumford rigs a school
cannon by blocking its discharge with a cleaning rag, then modifies a shell
with a more powerful explosive so that the cannon will explode when Haynes
fires it the next morning, at a ceremonial occasion. Rumford pins the accident
on a cadet, Roy Springer, who has a history of behavioral demerits. Eventually
Rumford’s own fanatical sense of duty provides Columbo the clues that lead to
Rumford’s incrimination.

Final clue/twist: Rumford, an absolute stickler for the academy’s rules, is
determined to find a bottle of prohibited cider that he knows is on the
premises. Columbo himself finds the cider, and realizes there is a connection
between it and the murder. He gains the confidence of the cadets who made the
cider, and has them tell him everything about how and when it was made. Once
he learns that information, he asks Rumford if he had seen the cider
previously. When Rumford says yes, it incriminates him. Columbo tells him he
could have seen the cider only on the morning of the murder (the cider had
been hung out to ferment at night, and as such was only visible around
sunrise), and only if he was standing very near the cannon (because of the
location of the trees on the academy grounds). So on the morning of the murder
Rumford was not asleep, as he had claimed; instead, he must have been at the
cannon.

how to murder someone and get away with it [Colonel Lyle C. Rumford goaded his superior into firing a cannon he went to elaborate lengths to rig to explode at a ceremonial occasion, taking care to make the cause of the accident look like an act of negligence by a cadet he did not much like. One gathers that he would have gotten away with his crime had it not been for the meddlesome Lt. Columbo.]

:: Major Themes
law enforcement [The bumbling but sharp-witted homicide detective Lt. Columbo was tasked with solving the following alleged murder mystery: Was the military academy present's getting blown to bits when firing a ceremonial cannon due to the negligence of a young cadet, or did someone higher up have it in for him?]
military related work [The villain of the story Colonel Lyle C. Rumford was the head of a military academy for boys. The viewer is shown the strict daily regimen that the cadets were expected follow, and Colonel Rumford prided himself on running a disciplined operation.]
what it is like in school [The story is set at a military academy for college age boys. Much attention is paid to the boys being subjected to a disciplined mode of life. There was a subplot about the boys fermenting a jug of cider in flagrant violation of academy regulations.]
discipline of a child [Colonel Rumford prided himself on turning the boys under his charge at the military academy into disciplined young men. In one pointed scene, Cadet Springer was made to wash a courtyard with a toothbrush as punishment for having skipped off to the neighboring girl's college in flagrant violation of academy rules.]
framing someone for a crime [Military academy head Colonel Rumford goaded the academy's Board of Trustees president into firing a cannon he'd rigged to explode, resulting in the president presumably being blown to bits, and tried to make it look the explosion was due to Cadet Springer's negligence.]
what if I were being framed for a crime [Cadet Springer was being framed by Colonel Rumford for the murder of William Haynes.]
youthful indiscretion [Cadet Springer was a stereotypical rebellious young man. He was generally insubordinate to his superiors at the academy, was in on the contraband cider fermenting operation, and had a penchant for skipping off to the neighboring girl's college after hours.]
opposition to authority [Cadet Springer had a chip on his shoulder, and routinely disobeyed his superiors at the academy.]
patriotism [Colonel Rumford was driven by a desire to play his part in making "the best damn army int he world, and Haynes Academy is going to be a part of it".]
pride [Colonel Rumford was exceedingly proud of Haynes military academy, which he ran, so much so he couldn't stand idly by and let girls be admitted to this traditionally boys only school. He resorted to murder most foul.]

:: Minor Themes
humility [Columbo made a self-deprecating remark about his mind being slow and him having to write everything down.]
Christianity [The academy chaplain said a few words in honor of Haynes at the academy chapel.]
be wary of strangers [A college girl told Columbo she doesn't talk to strangers, and subsequently questioned the authenticity of his police badge.]
boyfriend and girlfriend [Cadet Springer sought out his girlfriend for help while on the run from the law.]
being on the run from the law [Cadet Springer freaked out and resolved to head "up north" after being falsely informed that he was liable to be arrested for murder.]
skipping school [It transpired that Cadet Springer could, in fact, not have been responsible for the accident because said cadet had played hooky and spent a night with his girlfriend instead of performing his gun-cleaning duties like the colonel thought he had.]
young character vs. old character [Colonel Rumford and William Haynes were both variously compared and contrasted with young Cadet Springer. In his youth, Haynes had been rebellious much like Cadet Springer, whereas Colonel Rumford had already had stick up his behind for years.]
sexism in society [Colonel Rumfrod was dead set against having girls admitted to the boys only military school he ran.]

:: Description
While aboard a Mexican cruise he takes frequently, auto executive Hayden
Danziger has been having an affair with the lounge singer Rosanna Wells. When
Wells threatens to expose their affair to Danziger's wife, Sylvia, Danziger
decides to get rid of Wells. To set up his alibi, he inhales some amyl nitrite
to feign a heart attack in the swimming pool, so that he will be checked into
the ship's hospital. During a lapse in security, Danziger dons a crewman's
uniform, sneaks out of his hospital bed, and waits in Wells's cabin for her
performance break. When Wells comes back, Danziger shoots her, plants evidence
to implicate a band musician, Lloyd Harrington – who had been in a
relationship with Wells before she discarded him – ditches the pistol, and
returns to the hospital before the doctors can find him missing. Columbo,
vacationing on the cruise with his wife, is pressed into service by the ship's
captain.

Final clue/twist: Columbo convinces Danziger that he can only arrest
Harrington if they find the gloves he used during the murder, which would have
gunpowder residue on them. So Danziger puts on another pair of rubber gloves
and, down in the ship’s engines where he cannot be heard, fires a gun from the
magician’s show. The gloves are then conveniently left by Danziger to be found
by the ship’s crew. However when given the gloves to analyze, Columbo is no
longer interested in powder burns, instead he finds Danziger's fingerprints on
the inside of the gloves.

Harold Van Wick, the controlling, arrogant, gadget-obsessed president of Midas
Electronics, has wired his estate-home with closed-circuit television cameras
and video recorders. His mother-in-law Margaret Midas, who owns the company,
and who blames a steep drop in profits on Van Wick's costly fascination with
obscure gadgetry, orders him to resign his post by the following morning, or
she will expose his philandering ways to his wife, her daughter, Elizabeth.
Van Wick has already set in motion a scheme to murder her. He rigs his
high-tech home security system and shoots Margaret when she is in the viewing
field of one camera, feeding a recording of an empty study to the guard
monitoring the estate's rooms. Having already forced open a window and planted
footprints outside it to make the murder look like the deed of a burglar, he
then uses a timer to play back the tape of the shooting to the gatehouse
guard's monitor to make it look like Margaret was shot by an intruder after
Van Wick had left the house for a party. Robert Brown played Arthur Midas,
Margaret's son and Elizabeth's brother. Patricia Barry plays the owner of an
art gallery which provided Van Wick with his ostensible alibi, and Trisha
Noble plays her sexy assistant, who may have had an affair with Van Wick.

Final clue/twist: Columbo notices, while viewing security monitor recordings
from both before and after the murder, that Van Wick's invitation for the
party was still on his desk after leaving for the party. Van Wick had
presented the invitation to get access to the party that provided his alibi.
So Margaret had to have been shot sometime before the security guard viewed it
on the monitor, and, more damningly, Van Wick would practically have had to
step over the body to retrieve his invitation before leaving for the party.

mother-in-law and son-in-law [The plot turns on Harold shooting dead his no-nonsense mother-in-law, Margaret, to stop her from ousting him as president of the family electronics company. The few interactions they had in the lead up to her death were characterized by a tone of mutual hostility.]
technology [A novelty of the story was the Midas estate being equipped with such high-tech electronic gadgetry as closed-circuit television cameras, video recorders, and clap activated doors. The novelty of Harold's digital watch was featured.]
human pleasure [The villain of the story Harold Van Wick was fascinated with electronic gadgetry.]

A Deadly State of Mind

:: Description
Psychiatrist Dr. Mark Collier is having an affair with a patient of his, rich
housewife Nadia Donner. One day, Nadia invites Mark to a weekend sex vacation
at the Donner beach house. Collier shows up at the beach house only to be
unpleasantly surprised by Nadia's husband, Carl. The two men get into a
violent confrontation over Collier's affair with and drugging of Nadia, with
Carl threatening to damage Collier's reputation. When Collier surprises Carl
by attempting to leave with Nadia in tow, Carl attacks him. A scuffle ensues,
which ends with Collier bludgeoning Carl with a fireplace poker. After telling
Nadia to explain it to the police as a home invasion that turned tragic, done
by several masked men, Collier drives off, almost running over a blind man
walking his dog past the beach house. Investigating the scene, Columbo is not
satisfied with Nadia's version of events, wondering why Nadia didn't see the
headlights of the burglars' car. When Columbo tells Collier that Nadia's story
is not credible, Collier secretly hypnotizes her into, in effect, committing
suicide by taking a deadly dive from her fifth floor balcony into the swimming
pool below.

Final clue/twist: Columbo claims to have a witness to the first murder.
Collier is confronted with the eyewitness, a man wearing dark sunglasses who
looks just like the blind man Collier narrowly avoided hitting with his car
shortly after the murder. The man settles down on the couch, hands Columbo a
match, and then identifies Collier as the driver he saw at around the time of
the murder. Collier, as confident as ever, says that he has not been fooled,
that he knows the man is blind, and thus cannot be a witness to anything.
Collier challenges the man to read from a magazine he hands him, and is
stunned when the man does read from it. Columbo reveals that the man is the
brother of the actual blind man. But Collier has incriminated himself. In
“knowing” that the witness was blind, he has established that he was at the
scene of the crime. He has in effect been an eyewitness against himself.

how to murder someone and get away with it [Realizing that Lt. Columbo was hounding in on their scent and that he could not rely on Nadia to keep her lies consistent, Mark came up with the following elaborate plot to rid himself of this liability of a partner in crime: He hypnotized Nadia under the pretext of helping her pass a lie detector test.

Forgotten Lady

:: Date
1975-09-14

:: Description
When elderly physician Henry Willis refuses to finance a return to the
spotlight for his wife, aging former movie star Grace Wheeler kills him in his
sleep, passing it off as a suicide. Their elderly butler believes Grace was in
a private screening room the entire time, watching one of her classic films.

Final clue/twist: Columbo believes that a discrepancy between the length of
the movie and the time it took Grace Wheeler to watch it, including the few
minutes it took her to fix the film after it ripped, proves that Grace spent
some time away from the screening room. It was then, Columbo concludes, that
she was out committing the murder. This is one of the only two episodes in
which the perpetrator is not arrested (the other being "It's All In The
Game"), as Ned Diamond, Wheeler's longtime song and dance partner who has
always loved Grace, falsely confesses to save her after Columbo informs him
she is suffering from a degenerative brain disease (the primary reason her
husband refused to finance her return as the physical strain of acting would
have killed her) and likely no longer even remembers the murder. Nonetheless,
Columbo is prepared to arrest her. Diamond makes his false confession to Grace
who briefly becomes hysterical. Columbo arrests Diamond, both realizing that
by the time he is cleared, Grace will have died. Columbo's normal instincts
thwarted, he makes several half turns – as though to enter the screening room
– where Grace, lost in the past, is watching the film, having already
forgotten Diamond's confession. Columbo then leaves the mansion, following
Diamond. The episode features excerpts from the 1953 musical comedy Walking My
Baby Back Home, which starred Leigh. It is Grace's favorite film, the one
playing when she was committing the crime and the one she is watching,
mesmerized, at the end of the episode.

An amusing concurrent side-story concerns Columbo's penchant for not carrying
his firearm and his decade-long lapse in going to the range for shooting
proficiency. He has been evading Sgt. Leftkowitz whose computer records show
the lapses. Finally, while Columbo is eating an ice cream cone with his dog,
an Internal Affairs officer tells him he has 24 hours to appear at the range
or his badge will be pulled. (Columbo lends his badge to a crony whom he asks
to go to the range in his place, claiming he cannot pass the shooting
proficiency test.)

A Case of Immunity

1975-10-12

:: Description
Hassan Salah, chief diplomat of the Legation of Suari, an Arab nation with a
new young king, has a scheme for shifting power within his government. He
enlists Rachman Habib, a naïve idealist in the Legation, to help him stage the
murder of a security officer, then plants evidence to make it look like the
work of radicals. Salah pins the murder on the now-absent Habib, who, as part
of the plan, has gone into hiding. Salah later kills Habib as well. Columbo
unravels the truth, but finds himself stymied by Salah's diplomatic immunity.
Columbo then meets the new king, who is on a diplomatic visit to the United
States, and is liked by the young monarch.

Final clue/twist: Columbo gets Salah, still under diplomatic immunity, to
confess to the murder with the king listening in from the next room. To stay
in the U.S. rather than be sent back to Suari and the torture that it is
implied he would face, Salah signs a confession and waives his immunity from
prosecution.

A Matter of Honor

:: Date
1976-02-01

:: Description
Retired and renowned matador Luis Montoya is a Mexican national hero. His
trusted bookkeeper, Hector Rangel's son Curro is also a bullfighter. When
Curro is gored in the bullring, Montoya freezes up in fear and does not
challenge the bull. He later decides to kill Hector, who knows what happened.
Montoya lures Hector to the ring, where he shoots him with a tranquilizer gun,
and unleashes the bull on the prone man. The result is that it appears Hector
tried to take revenge on the bull that gored his son. Columbo, who just
happens to be in Tijuana for the weekend, is recognized by a suspicious local
chief of police, who enlists Columbo's help.

Final clue/twist: Due to the condition of the muleta used to attract the bull,
Columbo deduces the time frame of the murder, a period for which Montoya has
no alibi. To prove Montoya's motive, Columbo persuades Curro to lure Montoya
into the ring. The bull is then released, and the ex-matador again becomes
paralyzed with fear, this time in front of witnesses. This episode is
noteworthy as the murderer's motive is not revealed until the very end.

:: Choice Themes
how to murder someone and get away with it [The retired matador Luis Montaya resolved to dispose of Hector Rangel when Hector learned Luis' embarrassing secret, that he was deathly afraid of a bull, in the following elaborate way: Luis tricked Hector to go to the arena and shot him with a tranquilizer dart. He then released the bull and let it gore Hector to death. One gathers that he would have gotten away with his crime had it not been for the meddlesome Lt. Columbo.]
the importance of reputation [The renowned matador Luis Montoya' reputation was at the center of the plot. Luis had murdered Hector in order to prevent it from being known that Luis was deathly afraid of a bull. The police's work was made politically perilous by the fact that Louis was a national hero.]

:: Major Themes
law enforcement [The bumbling but sharp-witted homicide detective Lt. Columbo was press-ganged into assisting the Mexican police with resolving the mystery of the death of Hector Rangel. Had Hector really just sauntered into the arena to challenge a ferocious bull and lost, or was there foul play at work?]
blood sports [That controversial physical contest or pseudo-sport (depending on how you view it) popular in Spanish culture countries, bullfighting, was at the center of the plot that Columbo had to unravel.]
human vs. beast [The story concerns bullfighting in general, and a renowned bullfighter's sudden fear of facing a certain bull, in particular.]
fear for one's life [Luis had become paralyzed with fear at the prospect of facing the murderous bovine. This weakness became his undoing when Columbo staged a trick to expose him as the murderer.]
pride [The retired matador Luis Montoya prided himself on his courage around the bulls, and was humiliated when he terror of the bull that had gored an up and coming bullfighter was revealed for all to see.]
what it is like to travel [The story follows Columbo on his trip to Tijuana.]
honor [Luis Montoya dishonorably slew his longtime friend and employee Hector Hector Rangel to protect his reputation as a fearless bullfighter and a national hero.]
foreign customs [Columbo learned all about the practice of bullfighting while "vacationing" in Tijuana. The ex-matador Luis impressed upon Columbo, who expressed a certain distaste at the prospect of watching a bull being killed in sport, that bullfighting was an important part of his culture, and perhaps not so different from a prize fight or the hunting of a deer with a rifle.]

:: Minor Themes
animal rights [Irresolute about cultural relativism, Columbo neither condemned nor condoned the Mexican practice of torturing large mammals to death as a public spectacle but instead made occasional pointed snide remarks about it.]
animal behavior [In order to resolve the conspicuous death of Hector, Columbo had to deconstruct bull psychology to an extent. He discussed with Luis what the bull would and would not have done, and how the bullfighter's muleta worked.]
father and son [Hector was upset that his son Curro had been gored by a bull. Hector tried to avenge himself on the said bull, or so Luis wanted everyone to think after Hector turned up dead.]
coping with a loved one being in peril [Hector was worried about his son who had been gored by a bull.]
boyfriend and girlfriend [Curro was dating Luis' daughter.]
blackmail [Columbo lightheartedly accused the Mexican police of blackmailing him after the chief told him they could possibly speed up the paperwork that would allow him to go home.]
dangerous driving [Columbo recklessly drove without valid motor insurance in Tijuana and ended up rear ending someone at estimated 5 MPH (or was it 10 MPH?), causing a grievous neck injury that may or may not have been entirely faked. Columbo's car was impounded and he had to butter up the Mexican police by resolving a tricky murder case in order to resolve the matter.]
con artistry [After rear-ending another driver at an estimated 5 MPH (or was it 10 MPH?), Lt. Columbo implied that the man's grievous neck injury was faked as part of a swindle to get indemnity.]
price inflation in society [After stating that his prize bull was worth $8,000, Luis corrected himself mid sentence by saying its value was more than when when accounting for inflation.]
father and daughter [Luis welcomed his daughter, Nina, back from Arizona.]
beating one's self up [Curro pointedly blamed himself for his father's death at the horns of a bull.]
coping with being ill and indisposed [Curro was in hospital convalescing from a bull goring.]
masculinity [A theory was advanced that Rangel faced the ferocious bull because of his machismo.]

Now You See Him...

:: Description
The Great Santini is a magician extraordinaire at a cabaret. He is also being
blackmailed by his insatiably greedy employer, impresario Jesse Jerome, over
the fact that he is actually Sergeant Stefan Mueller, a former Nazi SS prison
guard. Mueller tires of the arrangement and Jerome's demand for more money,
and kills his blackmailer in the middle of his famed water tank escape act,
giving himself what he believes to be an airtight alibi. He sneaks out of a
room where he hides during the act, makes his way dressed as a waiter through
the cabaret's kitchen and up to Jerome's office, shoots him, then returns to
his act with nobody noticing.

Final clue/twist: Santini is undone by the used carbon ribbon on Jerome's IBM
Selectric typewriter. The carbon ribbon has a clear imprint of everything
written with it, so it is in effect a copy of the letter Jerome was typing to
send to federal authorities, which revealed the motive for the murder. At his
arrest Santini remarks that he thought he had created the perfect murder;
Columbo remarks that a "perfect murder" is only an illusion.

Last Salute to the Commodore

:: Date
1976-05-02

:: Description
Commodore Otis Swanson is a retired naval officer who owns a shipbuilding
company, and is not happy with the shady dealings of his son-in-law Charles
Clay, who has turned the modest and upstanding business into a name-brand
production line for status-seekers. Nor is he pleased with any of the people
closest to him - his alcoholic daughter Joanna Clay, his middle-aged playboy
nephew Swanny Swanson, his lawyer Jonathan Kittering, and his shipyard manager
Wayne Taylor. He announces at his birthday party his intention to sell the
company. That night, someone murders the Commodore. Although we don't see the
murder on-screen, Clay is seen covering up the death by taking the Commodore's
body out on his yacht at night and throwing it overboard. Columbo investigates
with the help of a veteran sergeant and a 29-year-old rookie. The detective's
conviction that Clay committed the crime proves premature and inaccurate, an
unusual development for Columbo. Clay himself turns up dead and Columbo
realizes that someone else is responsible for both murders.

Final clue/twist: When Columbo holds what he says is Commodore Swanson's
pocket watch to every suspect's ear, only Swanny disputes it, saying "'Tisn't"
when he hears it ticking. The watch was broken at the time of the murder to
create a false time frame, and only the murderer would have known the watch no
longer works. Clay's motive for covering up the murder is because he thought
the killer was his wife due to planted evidence by Swanny; he was killed when
he realized who the real killer was.

This episode departs from the usual Columbo format in several ways. First, the
man implied to be the killer is not, and thus the episode becomes a true
whodunit, with the actual murderer revealed at the end. Second, neither of
the two murders is shown. Third, Columbo's personality is atypically agitated,
impatient and less superficially amiable than in most other episodes. Fourth,
regular clichés such as "Just one more thing" and "Something's been bothering
me" are absent from this episode. Fifth, rather than working alone, Columbo
works closely alongside two other police officers, who at times interrogate
suspects. Finally, the episode departs from the usual style in presenting a
far greater emphasis on comedy, including some minor slapstick elements, and
features a less dramatic tone.

Fade in to Murder

1976-10-10

:: Description
Egocentric actor Ward Fowler, who portrays Detective Lucerne on a weekly TV
show, is being blackmailed by his producer and ex-paramour, Claire Daley, over
the fact that he was a deserter in the Korean War. Fowler drugs a friend
staying at his house watching a baseball game, puts it on tape delay, then
dons a ski mask and pretends to rob a delicatessen where Claire is shopping.
After Fowler knocks the proprietor unconscious and takes Claire's money, he
shoots her dead, then ditches the gun and mask. He begins stepping in and out
of character to "assist" Columbo with the investigation.

Final clue/twist: After Columbo has shaken Fowler's alibi, he confronts him
with his biggest mistake. There are no fingerprints on the murder weapon, but
Fowler left his fingerprints on the remaining live bullets inside the
revolver's chamber.

Molly, Mr Daley's secretary, is played by Shera Danese, who would eventually
marry star Peter Falk. Walter Koenig guest stars as a police sergeant. The
mechanical shark "Bruce" from Jaws makes a cameo as himself.

Old Fashioned Murder

1976-11-28

:: Description
The Lytton family owns and operates an antiquities museum. Ruth Lytton has
dedicated her life to the museum, never marrying and having no children,
although her niece Janie is as close to her as a daughter. Her brother Edward
is not nearly as dedicated to the family business as Ruth is; in fact, he
plans to close the museum and sell the building, as it's been losing money for
years. Ruth and Edward's sister (and Janie's mother) Phyllis Brandt is a
checked-out alcoholic who is likely to go along with Edward's decision. Ruth
enlists Milton Schaeffer, an ex-con who works as a guard at the museum, and
whose brother Tim is having an affair with Janie, in a complex plot where
Milton will steal some artifacts from the museum, fake his own death, and then
flee the country while Ruth collects the insurance money. But her real goal is
revealed when she double-crosses Milton during the robbery, and shoots him
dead, then kills Edward when he comes to investigate the gunshot. She then
plants guns on both men to make it look like they killed each other. When Ruth
realizes Columbo has not fallen for the staged robbery, she tries to frame
Janie for involvement in the crimes.

Final clue/twist: Ruth plants an ancient belt buckle in Janie's room to frame
her, and Janie is arrested for the murders. Columbo takes the buckle to
Janie's prison cell. When Janie uses it as an ashtray, Columbo knows she has
no idea what it is, so she could not possibly have had a hand in its theft.
Columbo comes to believe that, many years before, Ruth killed Janie's father,
Peter Brandt, whom she was going to marry until Phyllis snatched him away. To
protect Janie, who does not know much about her father’s death and his
relationships with the women in his life, Ruth persuades Columbo not to pursue
those questions and in return she will confess to the two current murders.

The Bye-Bye Sky High IQ Murder Case

1977-05-22

:: Description
Bertie Hastings discovers that his friend, Oliver Brandt, a senior partner in
an accounting firm, has been embezzling money to support the expensive
lifestyle of his beautiful wife, Vivian. Hastings refuses to remain silent,
even though he is friends with the volatile and egotistical Brandt. Brandt
then plots Hastings's murder at the Sigma Society, the headquarters of a
Mensa-type club for geniuses, intending to make it look like a burglary gone
bad.

Final clue/twist: Columbo uses Brandt's own Mensa-level intelligence and
vanity, along with his dislike of the other people in the society, to trap
him. After Columbo presents a ridiculous solution to how the murder took
place, specifically on how the murderer timed things so the sounds of gunshots
were heard coming from upstairs, immediately followed by the sound of a
falling body, an outraged and insulted Brandt shows him exactly how it was
done.

Try and Catch Me

:: Date
1977-11-21

:: Description
Esteemed mystery author Abigail Mitchell is convinced that her sole relative,
her nephew-in-law Edmund Galvin, murdered his wife, Mitchell's niece Phyllis,
in a boating "accident" four months earlier and got away with it. Not only
that, but Galvin inherited the rights to a play of Mitchell's, which Mitchell
had long ago signed over to Phyllis as a present. Mitchell decides to take
revenge and murder her nephew-by-marriage. She tricks Galvin into a false
sense of security by making him her heir. Then she lures him into her large
walk-in safe and slams the door shut, locking him in. Galvin, locked in an
airless and sound-proofed safe for the whole weekend, suffocates while
Mitchell flies off to New York.

Final clue/twist: Columbo eventually solves the case by piecing together clues
left by Galvin as he suffocated in the safe. The most incriminating is the
title page of Mitchell's latest manuscript "The Night I was Murdered", which
Galvin altered to read "I was murdered by Abigail Mitchell". At the end of the
episode, Mitchell asks Columbo if he can overlook what she did. Gordon's
character is one of the most sympathetic killers caught by Columbo and he
seems genuinely sorry to have to arrest her. However, he had earlier cautioned
her not to count on his being soft-hearted. She pays him a compliment to his
cleverness by remarking that, had he been the detective who had investigated
her niece's "disappearance," none of this need ever have happened.

Mariette Hartley plays Mitchell's trusted assistant, Veronica Bryce, who
becomes embroiled in the crime. G. D. Spradlin plays Mitchell’s attorney, who
in one scene seems to have guessed what she had done.

Murder Under Glass

:: Date
1978-01-30

:: Description
Paul Gerard is a renowned restaurant critic, but gets rich extorting money
from upscale restaurant owners in return for good reviews. When one of them,
Vittorio Rossi, decides to no longer pay and expose Gerard, the critic kills
him with a bottle of wine poisoned with fugu.

Final clue/twist: Columbo figures out that Gerard poisoned the wine via the
needle of the bottle opener, not in the pressure cartridge itself. He tricks
Gerard into attempting to poison him in the same way, which provides the final
evidence. Columbo then tells Gerard he suspected him almost immediately
because Gerard did not rush to a hospital to be examined after the police
informed him the man he just had dinner with died from poison. Throughout the
episode, Columbo and Gerard have been respectful to one another, but both
finally admit that they dislike each other. Columbo nonetheless asks Gerard
what he thinks of the meal he has just prepared, and the charming murderer
says, "I wish you had been a chef".

Make Me a Perfect Murder

:: Description
West Coast television production boss Mark McAndrews is promoted to a
high-level position in New York. He fails to name as his replacement the
logical successor, TV programmer Kay Freestone, because she is also his lover.
He gives her, as a consolation prize, a new Mercedes. She is more interested
in a gun he holds while he jokingly invites her to shoot him. Freestone takes
him up on it during an important preview for a new made-for-TV movie called
"The Professional", that she helped produce. She tricks the projectionist by
fiddling with the projector's timer and then sending him on an errand.
Freestone sneaks up to McAndrews's office and shoots him, then returns, hiding
the gun above the ceiling panels of an elevator, to make the reel change
successfully before the projectionist gets back.

Final clue/twist: Kay sees what she thinks is the murder weapon, now visible
against the lights of the elevator ceiling. She recovers and gets rid of it.
Columbo reveals that the actual gun had been discovered by the police some
time before, and an imitation was put where she would see it, to find out what
she would do. That she got rid of what she thought was the murder weapon
proves she must be the killer.

How to Dial a Murder

Film and game-loving mind control (or, as the doctor tells the detective,
"life control") seminar guru Dr. Eric Mason uses two trained Doberman
Pinschers, Laurel and Hardy, to maul his "best friend" Dr. Charlie Hunter to
death. Hunter had been having an affair with Dr. Mason's now-deceased wife,
who Mason may also have murdered.

Final clue/twist: When Columbo realizes that the dogs were trained to react
violently when a certain word is spoken, he has a long conversation with
Mason, hoping Mason’s ego will compel him to use the word while they talk.
This does happen. Columbo secretly recorded the conversation, and when the
tape is played to the dogs they again react with savagery. Columbo figures out
the word is "Rosebud". Columbo confronts Mason and provokes him by telling him
of all the mistakes he made. Mason orders the dogs to attack, by saying
"Rosebud" sharply and pointing to Columbo. However this time the dogs play
with Columbo instead of attacking him, as he had arranged to have them
retrained by a dog behavioral specialist.

The Conspirators

:: Date
1978-05-13

:: Description
Joe Devlin is a renowned Irish poet, author, and raconteur. He, along with his
own family and the heads of O'Connell Industries, is secretly a fundraiser and
gun-runner for the Irish Republican Army. He raises money in Los Angeles for
his radical cause through a charity ostensibly meant to help victims of
terrorism. Devlin has a strong belief in honor. Thus, when Vincent Pauley, an
arms dealer selling guns to Devlin, tries to skim off $50,000 for himself,
Devlin shoots and kills Pauley for being a traitor. With Columbo hot on his
trail, Devlin now in possession of the guns must arrange for their shipment
out of the country.

Final clue/twist: Columbo discovers that a bottle of whiskey at the crime
scene has the same glass markings that Devlin habitually makes when he drinks
from a bottle. Because every diamond has a unique cutting habit, Devlin's
ring, which he uses to mark his bottles, is proof of his presence at the crime
scene. Devlin accepts that Columbo has caught him, and is only disturbed when
at the last minute Columbo foils his gun-smuggling scheme (Columbo had
realized the guns were not yet on a ship going out to Southampton, but were on
a tugboat escorting the ship to sea; Columbo saw the tugboat had the colors of
the O'Connell shipping line).

This was the last episode of the Columbo series broadcast on the NBC
television network. Columbo's last line is "This far, and no farther", words
spoken by Devlin as he marked a whiskey bottle to determine how much he would
drink in a session. These words were taken from a speech by the Irish
Parliamentary Party (IPP) leader Charles Stuart Parnell, a 19th-century Irish
politician and supporter of Home Rule. A noted IPP politician of the same name
as the fictional killer in this episode, Joseph Devlin, represented West
Belfast early in the 20th century and opposed the use of violence in the cause
of nationalist politics.

Elliott Blake is a "psychic" who, with his girlfriend/partner in crime Dr.
Paula Hall, is attempting to scam U.S. military intelligence into hiring him
to use his ESP abilities against the Soviets. Blake and Hall rig a test with a
stock set of Zener cards, but the Army wants more proof of Blake's abilities.
They bring in Max Dyson, a magician with a side job in exposing fake psychics.
Dyson, who has never failed to expose frauds, comes up with a new test for
Blake. Three Army officers drive to randomly selected areas and take pictures
of whatever they see. Then they will attempt to transmit those images to Blake
with their thoughts. To the surprise and delight of the Army officials, Blake
passes the test. What they don't know, however, is that Blake and Dyson are
old acquaintances who both did time together in a Ugandan prison, and Dyson
helped his old friend rig the test for old times' sake. Unfortunately for
Dyson, Blake holds a grudge against Dyson for ratting out his escape plans to
the guards, getting himself an early release and getting Blake three more
years. Given a chance at revenge, Blake takes it: he traps Dyson in Dyson's
own homemade guillotine, and decapitates him. Columbo now has to solve the
crime before the government whisks Blake beyond his reach, changing his
identity.

Final clue/twist: Columbo tricks Blake into a confession and attempted murder
by taunting him with a promise to investigate him for the murder for as long
as it takes to bring him down. When Blake tries to kill Columbo with the
guillotine, he confesses while he's pulling the plug. But because Columbo has
rigged the guillotine, he is unharmed.

Boy genius Hollywood director Alex Brady, prior to becoming a success, made a
16mm movie in which a young woman, Jenny Fisher, was killed in a motorcycle

made it to the filming, leading the official investigation to conclude that it

cameraman. Leonard vows to use the film to destroy Brady, who kills him, using
one of his studio movie sets.

Final clue/twist: When he realizes that Columbo is coming closer and closer to
solving the murder, Brady hires two actresses to enact a scripted conversation
in the studio commissary for Columbo to overhear, hoping it would misdirect
him. Columbo is not fooled, noticing that one of the actresses was dressed as
a nurse when there were no scenes filmed during the studio that day that
required one. Columbo then beats Brady at his own game, using undercover cops
to "play the part" of the commissary staff so they can overhear Brady trying
to bribe his secretary to keep quiet.

involved both professionally and personally with her business partner David
Kincaid. That is, until late one night when Dr. Allenby makes an unexpected
after-hours trip to her office and catches David in flagrante delicto with her
assistant Cindy Galt in the therapy room. Dr. Allenby is incensed, and decides
to kill David. To do so, she takes a page right out of her own book. She first
disguises herself as a sexually aggressive, high-class prostitute named
"Lisa", wearing a black wig and sexy black clothing, that she stashes in the
women's bathroom of a fundraiser she's attending. During the fundraiser, she
sneaks to the bathroom to change into her disguise. She then sneaks out in the
disguise and goes over to a nearby bar where she's arranged for David to meet

Grand Deceptions

:: Date
1989-05-01

:: Description
Colonel Frank Brailie is running a paramilitary mercenary school owned by
General Jack Padget. Brailie is also having an affair with Padget's wife
Jenny. Brailie is siphoning money from Padget's foundation into what he calls
"The Special Projects Fund", which is secretly used to finance illegal
dealings. The suspicious General asks an employee, Sgt. Major Lester Keegan to
look into the matter. Keegan finds the evidence but decides to blackmail
Brailie instead of reporting his findings. During a training exercise,
occurring on the night of the General's birthday party, Brailie sneaks into
the mercenary camp, wearing a ski mask, and stabs Keegan, then puts the body
on an explosive that is detonated. He sneaks back to the General's estate and
makes it look like he was assembling a diorama of the Battle of Gettysburg at
the time.

Final clue/twist: Columbo realized that a shipping box labeled as having
contained books (which Brailie received earlier on the day of the murder) was
too small to contain the number of books it was supposed to contain, and thus
the box must have instead contained the toy soldiers for the diorama, and the
books must have arrived in a shipment that arrived later (which Brailie
claimed contained the toy soldiers). This meant that Brailie had swapped the
labels on the boxes and had had enough time to set up the diorama over the
course of the day, and therefore had no alibi for the time of the murder.

Murder: A Self Portrait

:: Date
1989-11-25

:: Description
Temperamental artist Max Barsini effectively lives with three women: his
ex-wife, Louise, his young live-in model Julie, and his current wife Vanessa.
Barsini takes delight in the way they fight for his attention. But when Louise
begins seeing a therapist, Dr. Hammer, who is also her new fiancé, Barsini
fears she will reveal that he killed his first agent, who was robbing him. He
kills Louise, then makes it look like she drowned at the beach while he was at
Vito's bar, painting. Columbo poses for Barsini while investigating him.

Final clue/twist: Columbo can prove that a spot on Louise's face was not
washed-up make-up but was instead remnants of "Barsini red", a special color
mixed only for Barsini, and that it was on the cloth she was benumbed with.

Columbo Cries Wolf

:: Date
1990-01-20

:: Description
When Dian Hunter, the partner of men's magazine publisher Sean Brantley,
vanishes after expressing a desire to sell her 51% interest to a rival,
suspicion falls on Sean and his girlfriend Tina. Columbo sets out to find the
body, eventually digging up much of Brantley's estate and breaking open the
walls. But after the search turns into a full-blown media event, Dian
resurfaces, explaining she needed some time to herself. Dian and Sean planned
the disappearance as a publicity stunt to increase sales. But to his shock,
she actually intends to sell now that her holding is more valuable. Sean
proceeds to then kill Dian for real and hides the body, believing that Columbo
will not be allowed to search for it again. Richard Levinson and William Link
wrote the story for this episode, but were uncredited.

Final clue/twist: Dian apparently left wearing a fur coat. Columbo gets
suspicious when he sees all her remaining fur coats in plastic storage bags,
deducing that Brantley put the body in the missing bag. Knowing he will not be
supported in a second full search, he phones the pager Dian wears as a
wristlet: it is on her body, behind a finished section of the replacement wall
being installed; which Columbo tears down. (The word Columbo uses to ring the
pager is "Gotcha".)

Agenda for Murder

:: Date
1990-02-10

:: Description
Oscar Finch is a lawyer who uses underhanded methods to get his clients off,
like coercing Paul Mackey, who worked for the D.A.'s office, into destroying
evidence against racketeer Frank Staplin in 1969. Twenty-one years later,
Mackey is chosen by a presidential candidate, Governor Montgomery, to be his
Vice Presidential running mate. Finch himself hopes that he might be appointed
as the next Attorney General. Staplin, facing another indictment, threatens to
expose the long-ago favor and ruin Finch's and Mackey's political futures if
he doesn't arrange the destruction of another document. Finch decides to
murder him. He scatters cigar ashes to make it seem he was in a late-night
meeting with a contributor when the murder occurred. Finch walks to Staplin's
house, shoots him and makes his death look like a suicide.

Final clue/twist: After Columbo learns that Staplin hadn't eaten any of the
cheese on the dish at the crime scene, but that the block of cheese had had a
piece bitten off from it, he assumes that the murderer must have taken a bite.
CSI can fabricate a toothprint from the cheese and Columbo finds more than
enough samples of Finch's toothprint on his discarded pieces of chewing gum -
proving that he was at the crime scene.

Rest in Peace, Mrs. Columbo

The episode is partially told in flashbacks from the funeral of Columbo's
wife. Vivian Dimitri is a real-estate executive whose recently deceased
husband had been sent to prison by Columbo. She seeks revenge by plotting to
kill the Columbos. But first she murders her boss, Charlie Chambers, her
husband's partner who avoided prison by informing on him. Vivian shoots
Chambers in his office, using her affair with married Leland St. John to
establish an alibi. Then she plants evidence to make it look like Chambers was
killed by disgruntled residents of a new housing development he was
constructing. Her plan is then to kill the Columbos with a jar of poisoned
marmalade. Roscoe Lee Browne plays her psychiatrist, Dr. Steadman.

Final clue/twist: Figuring out Dimitri's plan, Columbo and the police fake the
death of his wife. After the big "funeral", Columbo invites Vivian into what
she thinks is his house. He makes himself toast with marmalade. While Columbo
pretends to be dying of poison, Dimitri confesses to all three murders. He
then breaks character, and tells her that he'd suspected her all along, and
had the marmalade tested as soon as she gave it to him. They are actually in
the home of another officer, who recorded the confession, and the marmalade
jar is a different one.

Uneasy Lies the Crown

:: Date

:: Description
Dentist Wesley Corman decides to get rid of his unfaithful wife, Lydia,
and use her money to support his gambling habit. When Adam Evans, a Hollywood
heartthrob having an affair with Lydia, comes under his care, Corman puts a
time-release poison made from digitalis under a crown. It takes effect when
the couple are together that evening and Corman is playing cards, thereby
framing Lydia for the murder. Paul Burke co-stars as Horace Sherwin, Lydia's
father, also a dentist.

Final clue/twist: Columbo traps Corman by taking advantage of the fact that
Corman was never good at chemistry. He orders Evans' body exhumed and
demonstrates to Corman that if there was indeed digitalis, it would have
caused a chemical reaction with the porcelain in the crown, making a blue
stain on Evans' tooth underneath the crown. Before they begin to examine
Evans' mouth, Corman confesses. Of course, Columbo faked the demonstration:
there would be no such reaction.

This same storyline was first used in the McMillan (formerly McMillan & Wife)
episode "Affair of the Heart" that had aired in 1977. Bochco shared writing
credit for the earlier version with Leonard Stern.

:: Description
Jess McCurdy fails to convince her sister, best-selling romance novelist
Theresa Goren, to cancel her wedding to Wayne Jennings, a playboy/tennis bum
half her age and a gold digger. McCurdy impersonates her sister on the phone
with Jennings and dumps him. Jennings reacts by killing Goren - twice. He
arranges an alibi for the first murder, then returns and shoots her corpse. He
allows Columbo to "catch" him for the second murder, which he confesses, but
then "learns" that he had only shot a corpse, so is innocent of murder, which
he assumes will be blamed on a burglar.

Final clue/twist: Columbo untangles the plot with his surprisingly detailed
familiarity with the location of the tag on women's panties. He proved that
someone else put Goren's underwear onto her corpse, and that this someone
could only be a man, because only a man would put the panties on backwards. A
murderous burglar wouldn't have bothered to dress the corpse; only Jennings
would have a reason to do so, to help his alibi.

truck's engine compartment. With an airtight alibi, the boys then plant
evidence to make it look like the professor was killed because of a Mafia
exposé he was working on.

Final clue/twist: Columbo tricks the murderous duo by letting them "overhear"
details of a car owned by a suspect. After the murder weapon is found in the
car, he reveals it is actually his wife's car. Because only they could know
which car it was, they must have planted it and must be the murderers.

Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health

:: Date
1991-02-20

:: Description
Wade Anders is a former security consultant, and now host of the popular
America's Most Wanted-esque crime show CrimeAlert. One day, he gets an
unexpected visit from his rival, the chain-smoking newscaster Budd Clarke,
whom he blocked from becoming the CrimeAlert host. Clarke has resented that he
was snubbed in favor of Anders, but now, he has got some leverage that he
hopes will get Anders out of the CrimeAlert chair: a porn video that Anders
starred in many years ago. Clarke plans to go public with the tape unless
Anders resigns from the show. Anders decides to kill him rather than be
disgraced by a scandal. He palms a pack of Clarke's cigarettes, which he
doctors with a few drops of alkaloid poison nicotine sulfate. Anders then pays
two visits to his production office, once that night and again the next
morning - so a surveillance tape there will show him at the office all day.
Anders then drives to Clarke's house, and switches a cigarette pack for the
poisoned pack. Once Clarke takes one of the poisoned cigarettes and dies,
Anders makes it look like Clarke had a heart attack at his desk.

Final clue/twist: Columbo can prove that the surveillance tape was fabricated,
because the trees and bushes visible in front of the office appeared to have
been trimmed in the morning, but had supposedly grown again by the evening.
The fact that Clarke's dog scratched Anders' car, making distinctive marks
because of its missing claw on one of its paws, provides further evidence that
Anders had indeed visited Clarke's house before.

Directed by: Daryl Duke. Story by: Sonia Wolf, Patricia Ford, and

Columbo and the Murder of a Rock Star

:: Date
1991-04-29

:: Description
Rock star Marcy Edwards has been the live-in lover of high-priced murder
lawyer Hugh Creighton for several years. He learns that she is having an
affair with someone else and throws her out of his house. However, Marcy
blackmails Creighton into letting her stay, at least until he comes up with
the $5 million she is demanding in exchange for not filing a palimony suit
against him or exposing his unconventional practice methods. Creighton's
response is to drug the champagne in her beach house and wait until she shows
up there with her current lover. Having previously ensured that Marcy cannot
drink by lacing her tea with disulfiram, Creighton waits until her new lover
is passed out, then strangles her. Her lover awakens and flees the scene.
Creighton enlists his associate, Trish Fairbanks, to help him concoct an
airtight alibi, but when she finds out what he has done, she blackmails him
into a full partnership in the firm, wisely going the extra mile by creating a
contingency plan to ensure that killing her is not an option for Creighton.
Columbo cracks the case, despite the existence of a speed-camera ticket which
appears to exonerate Creighton completely.

Final clue/twist: Due to shadow angles in the picture of the speeding ticket,
Columbo can prove that Creighton's face was just a flat cut-out mask and that
Fairbanks must have been driving Creighton's speeding vehicle, and breaking
his alibi. Also, marks on Edwards neck matched the gloves found in the
gardener's truck that had been stolen, parked on a particular street where an
unusual type of tree grows, and returned. The windshield wiper wells on
Fairbanks' car collected the berries and droppings of these trees, proving
that Creighton parked her car on that street and also drove the truck there.

Death Hits the Jackpot

:: Date
1991-12-15

:: Description
Down-on-his-luck photographer Freddy Brower wins a $30 million lottery. But he
wants to keep the money a secret from his wife Nancy, who is divorcing him, so
that she cannot make a claim for the money. Freddy goes to his uncle, wealthy
jeweler Leon Lamarr, who offers to pretend that the lottery ticket is his own
until Freddy's divorce is finalized. Unfortunately, that is where Freddy's
luck runs out: he does not know that Lamarr has recently gone bankrupt, and is
also having an affair with Nancy. Lamarr decides to kill Freddy to keep the
lottery winnings for himself. He schedules a Halloween costume party at his
house, during which he sneaks out to Freddy's apartment, knocks him out,
undresses him, then drowns him in his bathtub. Nancy calls Lamarr during the
party pretending to be Freddy.

Final clue/twist: The night of the murder, Brower was taking care of a
friend's chimpanzee. Columbo learns that the chimp liked to handle shiny
objects, and finds the chimp's fingerprints on a medallion that was part of
Lamarr's Halloween costume, proving that Lamarr was at Brower's apartment that
night. When confronting Lamarr, Columbo calls Nancy in to thank her for her
"cooperation" and to let her know she will be the sole beneficiary of the
winnings. Columbo knew Lamarr would think Nancy has implicated him, so Lamarr
not only confesses to the murder, but reveals Nancy's involvement in the
crime.

:: Description
Given a deadline to pay his debts, or else, chronic gambler Harold McCain
plants a bomb under the Rolls-Royce of his uncle, professional football team
owner Big Fred. The bomb is set to explode when the engine is started.
However, someone else gets to Big Fred before Harold's bomb does by stealing
the gardener's pickup truck and running him over while he is jogging. Harold
tries to remove the bomb before it kills someone else, but cannot get near the
Rolls-Royce due to police and security on the premises. When the gardener
tries to move the Rolls-Royce out of the way of the TV camera crews, the bomb
explodes, killing the gardener. Columbo investigates and discovers clues that
link Harold to the car bomb, but Harold denies any involvement and tries to
divert suspicion away from himself. Fred's wife Dolores, appears traumatised
at losing her husband but has a good time as Fred's team's owner, but after
Harold tries to squeeze her for money, he is shot dead in his cabin, making it
appear obvious who is responsible.

Final clue/twist: The TV news tape shows Harold closing his eyes before the
Rolls-Royce exploded, thus proving that he knew there was a bomb under the
car. Columbo discovers that Harold's alarm was set to 8 pm, not 8 am. Harold
had spent the entire night at a casino, where he won $5,000 and had breakfast;
then he had a haircut and went to Dolores's house, which Columbo proves with
recently cut hairs found inside Harold's hat that was in Dolores' den. Dolores
shot Harold and moved his body to his cabin, but left Harold's hat at her
house. Before Harold planted the bomb, Dolores moved the Rolls-Royce onto the
driveway so the gardener could not drive his truck in. Dolores then sent the
gardener to the back of house so that he would not see her steal his truck and
run Big Fred over. Harold suspected Dolores was involved and was implying
blackmail when he asked her for money. When Dolores demands that Columbo prove
it, he replies, "I don't have to prove it, ma'am. One in the hand is better
than two in the bush," and arrests her for Harold's murder.

Wealthy socialites Lauren Staton and Lisa Martin conspire to murder their
abusive, two-timing lover Nick Franco. Lisa lures Nick into his apartment, but
Lauren commits the actual murder by shooting him and then fleeing. Lisa stays
behind in the apartment, keeping the body warm for several hours with an
electric blanket until Lauren returns to the complex and begins talking with
the building manager. While they're in the hallway, Lisa fires a shot into the
air, then flees through the patio in disguise, making it seem like the murder
happened right then. During the whole investigation, Lauren takes all the heat
from Columbo to protect Lisa, even going so far as to romance him.

Final clue/twist: When Columbo discovers that Lisa was the only person Nick
had talked to by phone in the ten days prior to his death, Columbo searches
her apartment and comes across a photograph of her posing next to a
one-of-a-kind antique chair similar to the one that Lauren had posed with in
another photograph he had also seen. Upon comparing the two photos
side-by-side, he concludes that it was the same chair, and same location, in
both photos, indicating to him that Lisa and Lauren might actually know each
other. He brings Lisa in for questioning and has Lauren watch behind a one-way
mirror. As it turns out, Lisa is Lauren's daughter, and when Lauren sees Lisa
being loudly interrogated by Columbo's associates, Lauren breaks down and
offers to confess on the condition that Columbo let Lisa go. Lauren admits to
the murder, but refuses to name Lisa as her accomplice. When Columbo learns
that Lauren's motive was to avenge Nick's cheating as well as his physically
attacking Lisa with a razor, Columbo rips up the photo evidence implicating
Lisa, deciding not to charge the daughter as she heads back to Rome. This is
one of two episodes (the other being "Forgotten Lady") in which Columbo allows
a murderer to go unpunished.

Lauren went back to Nick's apartment complex late that same night under the pretense of paying him a visit. Having "forgotten" her key, she asked the building manager to let her in Nick's apartment. Lisa fired a shot into the air once Lauren and the building manager were within earshot, and then hightailed it out of there with the electric blanket, leaving behind only the warm body.

that point, Chase enters the next room and shoots Winters, then makes it look
like Winters was shot by a gay lover.

Final clue/twist: A cell phone is a key to Columbo's solution of the crime.
Chase claimed that after hearing the murder on his phone at his mountain home,
he started to drive to Winters's house, then quickly realized he should call
911 and used his cell phone. But, Columbo realizes, there is no cell coverage
on the part of the mountain road near Chase's house, where his car would have
been.

Undercover

:: Date
1994-05-02

:: Description
Irving Krutch, a crooked insurance investigator, enlists the help of Columbo
to solve a series of murders that starts when two men, each of whom possesses
a piece of a photograph, kill each other in a burglary gone wrong. Some years
back a group of four men robbed a bank, but all of them were killed by the
police in a shootout after they were caught in a car accident. But before they
died, they hid their loot somewhere which can only be found through the
assembled photograph. Columbo must go undercover to recover some of the
pieces, solve some murders to get some others, and all the while trying to
figure out what Krutch might be after. Burt Young has a cameo as a small time
hood and Columbo does comic relief in the roles of a mob wise guy and a gang
boss.

This episode is based upon the 87th Precinct novel Jigsaw by Ed McBain,
although not credited as such. This installment thus departs from the usual
format by not revealing the culprit until the end of the show. Unlike the
previous episode based on McBain source material, No Time To Die, this
features a regular character from the 87th Precinct series, Arthur Brown,
played by Harrison Page.

Strange Bedfellows

:: Description
Graham McVeigh is a thoroughbred ranch owner, and he is tired of his brother
Teddy being in constant debt to mob bookie and restaurateur Bruno Romano. He
decides to kill Teddy and frame Romano for the crime. To do so, Graham makes
Teddy take a big loss at the race track by drugging his own horse so that it
loses, leaving Teddy in deeper debt to Romano. Graham then disguises himself
and goes to Romano's restaurant, where he sets mice loose in a bathroom. While
Romano is distracted setting traps for the mice, Graham calls Teddy from a
restaurant phone so that the phone records will suggest Romano called to set
up a meeting. Graham and Teddy then drive out to a secluded section of road.
Under the pretense of getting fresh air, Graham gets out, walks around the
car, steps up to Teddy's window and shoots him, then rides home on a folding
bike he stashed in the trunk. The next day, Graham invites Romano to come out
to the ranch, ostensibly to pay Teddy's debt. When Romano looks at a briefcase
containing the money, Graham shoots him, switches Romano's revolver for the
identical murder gun, and makes it look like self-defense. Romano's boss
Vincenzo Fortelli becomes involved, exerting pressure on McVeigh. To solve the
crime before Fortelli takes matters into his own hands, Columbo must work with
the gangster.

Final clue/twist: Columbo invites McVeigh to dinner at Romano's restaurant.
McVeigh accepts the invitation, but Columbo does not turn up. After the last
dinner guests leave, McVeigh quickly suspects that it is a set-up and that
Fortelli and his men are planning an ambush. Fearing for his life, McVeigh
contacts Columbo who says that he never invited him to the restaurant but
quickly makes his way there. After Columbo arrives, Fortelli threatens to kill
McVeigh unless he confesses to murdering Teddy. McVeigh denies it at first,
but fearing for his life even more, he eventually gives in and confesses to
the murder. He also reveals where he hid the gun and Columbo has two officers
quickly locate it. After McVeigh is arrested, Columbo reveals that the whole
confrontation was staged to get McVeigh to confess and Fortelli is impressed -
as he and Columbo had both planned the set-up.

A Trace of Murder

:: Date
1997-05-15

:: Description
Cathleen Calvert and her lover, crime scene investigator Patrick Kinsley, are
weary of having to see each other on the sly. She will not divorce her
husband, rich businessman Clifford Calvert, due to their prenuptial agreement.
So the lovers scheme to get him out of the way by killing Howard Seltzer, an
investment broker who is suing him, then framing Clifford for the murder. To
do so, Patrick drives to Seltzer's house and tricks Seltzer into letting him
inside by claiming that his car phone has died and that he has to make an
urgent phone call. Patrick then shoots Seltzer and plants evidence to suggest
that Clifford was responsible. Columbo's work is cut out for him, because
Patrick is on the team handling the investigation.

Final clue/twist: At a restaurant, Columbo sees Kingsley move the artificial
sweetener towards Cathleen Calvert when they all receive coffee. A few minute
later, Columbo sees Kinsley open the front door of a car for Cathleen Calvert
instead of the back door. Columbo realizes that despite their claims
otherwise, the two knew each other. If they had never met, as they claimed to
Columbo, Kinsley would not have known that Cathleen prefers the front seat
because she easily gets car sick when sitting in the back, or that she takes
artificial sweetener with her coffee. A wedding photographer's shot of the
Calvert couple dancing also helps reveal that the cat hair found on Clifford's
suit jacket was planted by Cathleen, while an earlier photograph shows that
Clifford did not have cat hair on his suit jacket prior to dancing with
Cathleen.

Ashes to Ashes

1998-10-08

:: Description
Funeral director to the stars Eric Prince, murders gossip columnist Verity
Chandler when she attends his latest funeral, that of actor and war hero Chuck
Houston. Chandler threatens Prince that her next exposé will be about him.
(Two decades earlier, he stole a valuable diamond from the body of a deceased
silent film star.) Prince bludgeons Chandler with a tool in his storage room,
then hides the body in a compartment used for corpses. After the funeral,
Prince takes the casket containing Houston's body to the preparation room,
where he puts Chandler's body into the casket in its place. It next enters the
cremation oven, and afterwards, the ashes are scattered by helicopter over the
Hollywood hills. Prince then goes to Chandler's house and fakes evidence of
her abduction. So that no one will become suspicious, he cremates Houston's
body by piggybacking him onto another corpse scheduled to be cremated.

Final clue/twist: Houston suffered a war injury in which a
distinctively-shaped piece of shrapnel remained stuck in his body for the rest
of his life. It was made of a strong metal that was not affected by the flames
of the cremation process. As Columbo said when confronting Prince, "Perhaps
you can explain how a piece of Mr. Houston's 50-year-old war record ended up
in the urn of a leisurewear importer."

Sally Kellerman plays the dead man's widow, Liz Houston, and Catherine
McGoohan, the real-life daughter of Patrick McGoohan, plays Rita, Prince's
assistant.

Murder with Too Many Notes

:: Date
2001-03-12

:: Description
Hollywood film composer and conductor Findlay Crawford has been mentor to a
talented young composer, Gabriel McEnery, who has been ghostwriting most of
Crawford's work for the last few years. Gabe even penned Crawford's last movie
score, which won an Oscar. Crawford realizes he will be ruined and ridiculed
if it ever becomes known. Aware that Gabe practices on the roof of a studio
building, Crawford plots his murder. He promises Gabe will get to conduct the
orchestra during a concert based on Crawford's "own" movie scores. While
giving a toast, Crawford drugs Gabe, then takes his body up to his rooftop
rehearsal place, which happens to be atop a trapdoor to a freight elevator. He
makes it look like Gabe was there rehearsing; With the concert about to begin,
Crawford starts the freight elevator, then makes it into the concert hall in
time to begin conducting before the elevator reaches the top. When the
elevator doors open, Gabe's unconscious body is pushed over the side and falls
to his death, landing in front of a late-arriving couple.

Final clue/twist: Columbo's first clue is that the victim did not cry out as
he fell to his death: On the victim’s body, Columbo finds a cut on his hand in
which dried blood reveals the presence of secobarbital, explaining why the
victim did not scream as he fell to his death; he was unconscious. This
explains why his shoes were two sizes too large and why his house key was
missing: the victim couldn’t complain because he was unconscious. In Columbo's
reconstruction of the Crime clues point to Crawford as the killer. Crawford
confirmed just before that McEnery would have heard the elevator that threw
him off the roof if he wasn’t unconscious.

:: Description
When Vanessa Farrow (Jennifer Sky) defends herself against an assault by her
ex-husband, mobster Tony Galper, she accidentally kills him. Her boyfriend,
Los Angeles rave promoter Justin Price (Matthew Rhys), whose new club Galper
was backing, helps Vanessa dispose of the body, but the events are secretly
photographed by tabloid photographer Linwood Coben, who offers Price the
negatives and prints for $250,000. Price agrees to pay, but when they meet,
Price kills him and makes it look like a suicide. Final clue/twist: Columbo
points out that one of the koi tanks built into the dance floor at Price's
club contains fewer fish and must be less deep than the other tanks. Columbo
has ground-penetrating radar used to find Tony's body hidden under the tank.
In the last line of the series, Columbo remarks to a galper "enforcer" that
"Tony was sleeping with the fishes." {Homage to "the Godfather" movie series)
(The club scenes use two tracks from the album Tweekend by The Crystal
Method.) NOTE: As a testament to the longevity of the series, the actors who
played the killers (Rhys and Sky) were not born yet during the first few
seasons of Columbo and Sky herself was only 12 when the series resumed in
February 1989.

This was the final episode of Columbo. It aired under ABC Thursday Night at
the Movies.
