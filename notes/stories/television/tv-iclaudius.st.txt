:: Description
Rome, 9-8 BC. Nine years have passed. Agrippa is dead and Tiberius has been
forced to marry Julia, divorcing his wife Vipsania Agrippina. Still deeply in
love, he continues to meet Vipsania secretly, enraging Augustus, but Livia
defends him by claiming that he had informed her of the meetings. Tiberius is
briefly comforted by the presence of his brother Drusus, who quarrels with
Livia before leaving once again on campaign. Drusus soon writes to Tiberius,
asking for his brother's help in convincing Augustus to retire and return Rome
to a Republic, but the letter is intercepted and read by both Livia and
Augustus. Augustus dismisses the letter as youthful impetuousness, but Livia
is clearly worried. Drusus falls from his horse and crushes his leg, and his
condition worsens under the oversight of Livia's personal physician. He dies
in the presence of his wife, Antonia, and their recently born son Claudius. A
year later, a drunken Julia enrages Tiberius with taunts about Vipsania, and
he strikes her across the face, resulting in his banishment from Rome.
Augustus looks forward to sharing his power with his grandsons Lucius and
Gaius when they come of age.

Rome, AD 3–5. Gaius has died and Tiberius has been banished to Rhodes for his
mistreatment of Julia, who has used his absence to have a series of hedonistic
affairs and orgies. One day in the garden, the young Claudius catches a wolf
cub dropped from an eagle's claws, leading a seer to predict that he will
protect Rome in an hour of need. Livia's scheming continues: knowing of the
mutual attraction between Claudius's sister Livilla and Julia's son Postumus
Agrippa, she arranges their betrothal to other people; she enlists Lucius'
friend Plautius as a spy against Julia, and tricks Lucius into revealing
Julia's infidelities. A grief-stricken Augustus banishes her from Rome. The

Livia's orders) ends Tiberius' exile and he returns to Rome to be named, along

What Shall We Do About Claudius?

:: Description
Rome, AD 9. Three Roman legions have been massacred in Germania at the Battle
of the Teutoburg Forest. Tiberius and Germanicus are dispatched to exact
revenge. While Claudius is in the library researching his family's history he
is advised by the historian Pollio to play up his infirmities to enhance his
place in his family as a harmless fool, and thus no threat to anyone. Augustus
has determined that Postumus will succeed him as Emperor, but Livia overhears
this. She tells Livilla she knows of her affair with Postumus and that during
the Republic there was civil war and that a single ruler is needed to bring
peace, so the succession can't be disputed. With Livilla's help, Postumus is
framed for rape. Postumus tells Augustus Livia has been killing those who
could prevent Tiberius succeeding but is not believed. Before he is banished,
Postumus tells Claudius his (correct) suspicions of all the people whom Livia
has killed and reiterates the advice that Claudius should continue to play the
fool. The episode ends with Claudius' marriage to Plautia Urgulanilla, who is
so much taller than him that he becomes the butt of his family's uproarious,
mocking laughter at their wedding.

Postumus and, now aware of Postumus' innocence, promises to pardon him.
Augustus privately thanks Claudius for his role in opening his eyes, and

Some Justice

:: Date
1976-10-18

:: Description
Rome, AD 19–20. Tiberius, with Sejanus' help, is ruling with an iron fist.
Only Germanicus is preventing total tyranny, but when he dies in Syria under
mysterious circumstances, it is widely rumored that Tiberius is behind it.
Germanicus' wife Agrippina accuses Piso, the governor of Syria, and his wife
Plancina of murder and treason. At Claudius' suggestion, they are tried in the
Senate, so as to avoid any backroom subversion of the courts by Tiberius'
agents. Martina, the poisoner, is held in a secret location before the trial
by Herod Agrippa and Claudius, but she is found by Livia's agents. She reveals
to Livia that Germanicus' own son, Caligula, aided her in bringing about his
death by convincing him that he had been cursed. Piso blackmails Livia and
Tiberius with evidence that they approved of Germanicus' murder. Livia
retaliates by threatening Plancina with Martina's testimony, but the incident
is enough to cause a permanent rift in her relationship with Tiberius.
Plancina attempts to convince Piso to commit suicide, knowing that she will be
spared by such an outcome. When Piso has second thoughts, Plancina stabs him,
bringing the trial to an end, and Agrippina and her friends have to be
satisfied that at least "some justice" was done. Caligula, after being
punished by Antonia for being found naked with his sister Drusilla, sets fire
to the family home in retaliation, burning it to the ground.

sister Aelia, after telling him his wife is pregnant by another man.
Unexpectedly, Claudius receives an invitation to dine with his now-elderly
grandmother Livia, who has not spoken to him in years. Anticipating her coming
death, Livia reveals to Claudius that an unpublished Sibylline prophecy claims
that both he and Caligula will one day become Emperor, and makes each of them
promise to make her a goddess so she can escape torment for her many misdeeds.
Claudius agrees on the condition that she reveal to him the full scope of her
crimes, which she does. On her deathbed she receives a visit from Caligula,
who rescinds his promise and reveals that he plans to become the greatest god
the world has ever known. Claudius, however, renews his promise to her, and

during Caligula's coma he would give his life if Caligula lived is forced by

:: Description
Rome, AD 54. Claudius' benevolent rule of Rome leads the populace to accepting
an emperor, but he decides that Rome must come to hate its ruling family,
overthrow it, and restore the Republic. To do this, he marries his niece
Agrippinilla and adopts her son Nero, making him co-heir with his son
Britannicus. Because of the Sibylline prophecy Livia revealed to him (in
"Queen of Heaven"), Claudius knows that Nero will become the next ruler of
Rome, but he still tries to protect Britannicus by planning to send him to
Britain so that he may take over later when Nero dies; unfortunately,
Britannicus does not believe in the republic and demands that he be allowed to
compete with Nero. Claudius, knowing the ultimate future, must leave his son
to his fate. Ready for his end, Claudius voluntarily eats a poisoned mushroom
from his wife's fork and dies. Looking for Claudius' will, Agrippinilla and
Nero come upon his autobiography and burn it. Lying on his bier, Claudius and
the Sibyl, knowing that Britannicus, Agripinilla and Nero will ultimately die
violently, have a good laugh over the fact that he buried another copy of his
book to be found later. Claudius is told that although the Republic won't be
restored, Nero will be last of the Claudians and most of the emperors that
follow won't be as bad.
