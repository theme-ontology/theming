:: Description
Rome, 9-8 BC. Nine years have passed. Agrippa is dead and Tiberius has been
forced to marry Julia, divorcing his wife Vipsania Agrippina. Still deeply in
love, he continues to meet Vipsania secretly, enraging Augustus, but Livia
defends him by claiming that he had informed her of the meetings. Tiberius is
briefly comforted by the presence of his brother Drusus, who quarrels with
Livia before leaving once again on campaign. Drusus soon writes to Tiberius,
asking for his brother's help in convincing Augustus to retire and return Rome
to a Republic, but the letter is intercepted and read by both Livia and
Augustus. Augustus dismisses the letter as youthful impetuousness, but Livia
is clearly worried. Drusus falls from his horse and crushes his leg, and his
condition worsens under the oversight of Livia's personal physician. He dies
in the presence of his wife, Antonia, and their recently born son Claudius. A
year later, a drunken Julia enrages Tiberius with taunts about Vipsania, and
he strikes her across the face, resulting in his banishment from Rome.
Augustus looks forward to sharing his power with his grandsons Lucius and
Gaius when they come of age.

Rome, AD 3–5. Gaius has died and Tiberius has been banished to Rhodes for his

What Shall We Do About Claudius?

:: Date
1976-10-04

:: Description
Rome, AD 9. Three Roman legions have been massacred in Germania at the Battle
of the Teutoburg Forest. Tiberius and Germanicus are dispatched to exact
revenge. While Claudius is in the library researching his family's history he
is advised by the historian Pollio to play up his infirmities to enhance his
place in his family as a harmless fool, and thus no threat to anyone. Augustus
has determined that Postumus will succeed him as Emperor, but Livia overhears
this. She tells Livilla she knows of her affair with Postumus and that during
the Republic there was civil war and that a single ruler is needed to bring
peace, so the succession can't be disputed. With Livilla's help, Postumus is
framed for rape. Postumus tells Augustus Livia has been killing those who
could prevent Tiberius succeeding but is not believed. Before he is banished,
Postumus tells Claudius his (correct) suspicions of all the people whom Livia
has killed and reiterates the advice that Claudius should continue to play the
fool. The episode ends with Claudius' marriage to Plautia Urgulanilla, who is
so much taller than him that he becomes the butt of his family's uproarious,
mocking laughter at their wedding.

Some Justice

:: Date

:: Description
Rome, AD 19–20. Tiberius, with Sejanus' help, is ruling with an iron fist.
Only Germanicus is preventing total tyranny, but when he dies in Syria under
mysterious circumstances, it is widely rumored that Tiberius is behind it.
Germanicus' wife Agrippina accuses Piso, the governor of Syria, and his wife
Plancina of murder and treason. At Claudius' suggestion, they are tried in the
Senate, so as to avoid any backroom subversion of the courts by Tiberius'
agents. Martina, the poisoner, is held in a secret location before the trial
by Herod Agrippa and Claudius, but she is found by Livia's agents. She reveals
to Livia that Germanicus' own son, Caligula, aided her in bringing about his
death by convincing him that he had been cursed. Piso blackmails Livia and
Tiberius with evidence that they approved of Germanicus' murder. Livia
retaliates by threatening Plancina with Martina's testimony, but the incident
is enough to cause a permanent rift in her relationship with Tiberius.
Plancina attempts to convince Piso to commit suicide, knowing that she will be
spared by such an outcome. When Piso has second thoughts, Plancina stabs him,
bringing the trial to an end, and Agrippina and her friends have to be
satisfied that at least "some justice" was done. Caligula, after being
punished by Antonia for being found naked with his sister Drusilla, sets fire
to the family home in retaliation, burning it to the ground.

Rome, AD 23/29. Claudius is invited to a dinner where the hostess, Lollia,
unexpectedly relates how she was forced to prostitute herself to Tiberius, and
then stabs herself. Tiberius now only lives for his perversions, in which
Caligula is only too happy to join. Sejanus effectively rules the empire,
overseeing continual treason trials of notable citizens and seizing their
property for the crown. He is having an affair with Livilla, who becomes so
enamored of him that she poisons her husband, Tiberius' son Castor to be able
to marry Sejanus. Sejanus manipulates Claudius into marrying his adopted
sister Aelia, after telling him his wife is pregnant by another man.
Unexpectedly, Claudius receives an invitation to dine with his now-elderly
grandmother Livia, who has not spoken to him in years. Anticipating her coming
death, Livia reveals to Claudius that an unpublished Sibylline prophecy claims
that both he and Caligula will one day become Emperor, and makes each of them
promise to make her a goddess so she can escape torment for her many misdeeds.

crimes, which she does. On her deathbed she receives a visit from Caligula,
who rescinds his promise and reveals that he plans to become the greatest god
the world has ever known. Claudius, however, renews his promise to her, and

:: Date
1976-11-01

:: Description
Rome, AD 30–31. Tiberius has retired to Capri. Sejanus consolidates his hold
on power in Rome by engineering the banishment of Agrippina and her eldest son
Nero and having her other son Drusus arrested and starved to death. Sejanus
has divorced his wife and approaches Tiberius about marrying Livilla. Tiberius
refuses as the marriage would mean Sejanus would be elevated in rank but
suggests that he could marry Livilla's daughter Helen. An outraged Livilla
attempts to poison Helen. Antonia discovers letters from her daughter to
Sejanus, implicating them both in several deaths and urging Sejanus to murder
Tiberius. Claudius smuggles the evidence to Tiberius. At Caligula's
suggestion, Tiberius orders Macro, an officer of the Guard, to carry out the
execution of Sejanus, his followers, and his family. Claudius barely escapes
by divorcing his wife. Meanwhile Antonia locks Livilla in her room and says
she will stay there until she dies.

Zeus, by Jove!

:: Date

:: Description
Rome, AD 37–38. Tiberius dies (actually smothered to death by Macro with
Caligula's connivance), leaving Caligula and Gemellus as his joint heirs.
Claudius' life-long friend Herod has returned to Rome in time for Caligula's
ascension. Caligula chooses Claudius to be his co-Consul, over Claudius'
objections. Caligula displays signs of mental instability and falls into a
coma; upon awakening he declares that he has become Zeus. Claudius humors him,
hoping that Caligula will reveal his divinity to the Senate and be deposed,
restoring the Republic; instead, the Senate accepts Caligula's claims of
divinity. Caligula becomes increasingly violent: a Senator who told Macro
during Caligula's coma he would give his life if Caligula lived is forced by
Caligula to commit suicide; Caligula also has Gemellus killed and declares his
sister Drusilla his wife and fellow goddess Hera. Disgusted with the depths of
depravity that her family and Rome have sunk to, Antonia commits suicide,
leaving Claudius distraught . Fearing that his child will become greater than
he, Caligula tries to recreate the birth of Athena: as Zeus reportedly did
with Metis, Caligula cuts his unborn child from his sister's belly and eats
it.

Rome, AD 40–41. Claudius is living with the ex-prostitute Calpurnia in meagre
circumstances. Caligula has turned the palace into a brothel where he sells
the wives of high-ranking Senate members to the highest bidder during sexual
orgies and forces Claudius to take money at the door. As a joke, he arranges
for Claudius to marry the much younger, extremely beautiful Messalina. Totally
insane, Caligula makes his horse Incitatus a senator, and takes his legions on
a campaign to Germany to put down an alleged rebellion and then to the English
Channel where he attempts to do battle with Neptune, bringing back seashells
as booty. Returning to Rome, he decides to execute the entire Senate for not
awarding him a Triumph for his 'victory,' but his wife Caesonia and Claudius
persuade him not to. Cassius Chaerea, a leading Praetorian officer whom the
Emperor continuously mocks, forms a plan with several others to assassinate
Caligula. They strike during the games held to celebrate Augustus, luring him
away from his German Guards and killing him. Cassius proceeds to murder
Caligula's wife Caesonia, and their infant daughter Julia Drusilla, attempting
to wipe out the Imperial family once and for all. While the suddenly-
leaderless Praetorian Guard are looting the palace, they come upon Claudius,
hiding behind a curtain, and proclaim him Emperor over his own protestations.

Rome, AD 41–43.The leaders of the Praetorian Guard and Herod convince Claudius
that he should take up the Imperial crown, since the alternative would mean

Senate to proclaim him Emperor. In his first act, he condemns Cassius for the
murder of Caesonia, but pardons the other conspirators. Livia is finally
deified and made a goddess. After successfully bearing Claudius children,
Messalina convinces him to share the burdens of power with her. As Herod will
soon be leaving to take control of the lands in the East that Claudius has
granted him, Messalina suggests that Appius Silanus, a Senator, be brought in
to assist her husband. Later her mother Domitia and Silanus marry. Before
Herod leaves he warns Claudius that, as Emperor, Claudius must trust no one,
not his advisors, not his wife, not even Herod himself. Messalina attempts to
seduce Silanus and tells him that Claudius approves, being just as corrupt as
the Emperors who preceded him. Silanus then attempts to kill Claudius in the
hopes of ending the line of depraved rulers. Messalina, with her mother's
help, convinces Claudius of her own innocence and Silanus is put to death.

Rome, AD 54. Claudius' benevolent rule of Rome leads the populace to accepting
an emperor, but he decides that Rome must come to hate its ruling family,
overthrow it, and restore the Republic. To do this, he marries his niece
Agrippinilla and adopts her son Nero, making him co-heir with his son
Britannicus. Because of the Sibylline prophecy Livia revealed to him (in
"Queen of Heaven"), Claudius knows that Nero will become the next ruler of
Rome, but he still tries to protect Britannicus by planning to send him to
Britain so that he may take over later when Nero dies; unfortunately,
Britannicus does not believe in the republic and demands that he be allowed to
compete with Nero. Claudius, knowing the ultimate future, must leave his son
to his fate. Ready for his end, Claudius voluntarily eats a poisoned mushroom
from his wife's fork and dies. Looking for Claudius' will, Agrippinilla and
Nero come upon his autobiography and burn it. Lying on his bier, Claudius and
the Sibyl, knowing that Britannicus, Agripinilla and Nero will ultimately die
violently, have a good laugh over the fact that he buried another copy of his
book to be found later. Claudius is told that although the Republic won't be
restored, Nero will be last of the Claudians and most of the emperors that
follow won't be as bad.
