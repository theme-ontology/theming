series Black Mirror. It was written by the series creator Charlie Brooker and
directed by Ally Pankiw. Alongside the rest of the sixth series, it premiered
on Netflix on 15 June 2023. It follows Joan as her life is adapted in real-
time into a Streamberry television series starring Salma Hayek.

Joan finds that the events of her day are being retold in near-real time in a
television programme, Joan Is Awful. The streaming service Streamberry can do
this as she signed their terms and conditions; a quantum computer produces the
show using computer-generated imagery (CGI). She is portrayed by a virtual
actor of Salma Hayek. To get Hayek's attention, Joan defecates in a church,
dressed as a cheerleader. Joan and Hayek—unhappy with how her likeness is
being used—break into Streamberry's office to destroy the quantum computer.
They learn that they are in a simulated reality. Joan is a likeness of Annie
Murphy based on a Source Joan; both destroy their quantum computers,
destroying the simulated realities. Source Joan is placed on house arrest
alongside the real Annie Murphy and starts her own coffee shop.

Directed by: Ally Pankiw. Story by: Charlie Brooker.

Demon 79

:: Date
2023-06-15

:: Description
A title card introduces the episode as a Red Mirror film. In 1979, Nida works
at a department store. People at her job, the National Front, and the
Conservative politician Michael Smart make it clear she is not welcome in
England. She discovers a talisman that unleashes a demon, Gaap, on his first
assignment. With the appearance of Boney M.'s Bobby Farrell, Gaap tells Nida
she must kill three people in as many days to stop the world ending. Nida
kills a passerby who molests his daughter. A man who murdered his wife invites
Nida to his house for sex; she kills him and his brother, who arrives as she
is leaving. The murderer's death is discounted, so one killing remains: Nida
targets Smart, who is seen in a premonition to become Prime Minister with an
ultra-nationalist agenda. She runs him off the road but is apprehended by a
police officer before his death. At midnight, with Nida in the interrogation
room, nuclear warfare begins. Nida joins Gaap, who is outcast by the demons,
in an eternal void.

Directed by: Toby Haynes. Story by: Charlie Brooker & Bisha K. Ali.

Teacher Amanda and welder Mike are a happy couple who want a child. After Amanda falls ill with a brain tumor, Mike agrees to a contract with the start-up Rivermind to restore her brain function remotely for a monthly fee. The company's servers wirelessly supplement her lost cognitive abilities. As a result, Amanda sleeps excessively and is unable to travel beyond Rivermind's service areas. She begins reciting advertisements involuntarily, causing issues at her job. Mike secretly funds an ad-free "Plus" version of the service by performing humiliating acts on a livestreaming platform. With excess money, he purchases a limited-time subscription for Rivermind "Lux", which allows them to alter sensory experiences through an app. After Mike is exposed for his online activities and assaults a coworker, he is fired, leaving them unable to afford the Plus subscription. They are also informed that Amanda's potential pregnancy would incur additional fees. A year later, Mike sells their unused crib and, at Amanda's request, smothers her with a pillow as she recites an advertisement. He enters his streaming room holding a box cutter and closes the door behind him.

:: Description
Maria, an R&D food scientist for a confectionery company, recognizes former classmate Verity during a focus group test. After Verity is instantly hired for a research assistant position, Maria begins noticing subtle discrepancies in her life, such as the name of the fast-food chain her boyfriend worked at. She also finds similar inconsistencies in her work, like the absence of an ingredient she had specifically identified in a new product, and blames Verity, whom she remembers was bullied in school. Maria attempts to use security footage to accuse Verity of drinking a coworker's milk from the communal refrigerator; however, the footage reveals that Maria committed the act, leading to her termination. Later, Maria breaks into Verity's home and discovers she has built a quantum computer capable of manipulating reality. Controlling it through her pendant, Verity had been using it to exact revenge on her bullies, including Maria, who spread rumors about her in school. Maria kills Verity, seizes control of the computer and pendant, and manifests a reality where she is empress of the universe.

:: Choice Themes
the desire for vengeance [At the heart of the story is the antagonist Verity, who was out to avenge herself on those who wronged her back in high school. She had built a quantum computer that could alter reality however she wished but no matter what she did, the pain of what had been done to her remained.]

childish bullying [Verity was out to avenge herself on Maria for a rumor that Maria and others had started back in high school. Specifically, Verity went to elaborate lengths to drive her former high school classmates Maria and Natalie to suicide for having made up a rumor at the time that Verity had given Mr. Kendrick a hand job in the computer lab.]
human vs. inexplicable adversity [From Maria's point of view, unexplainable and seemingly impossible things about reality simply kept changing. Words she knew she had written were suddenly, and embarrassingly, different. The final straw came when she referred to her nut allergy and found that the entire concept of "allergy to nuts" (perhaps the concept of allergies in general since people couldn't make sense of the words "nut allergy") had somehow vanished from existence.]
gastronomy [Maria was an up-and-coming food scientist at a chocolate-making company where she specialized in creating new recipes for delectable treats.]
coping with someone losing their mind [Maria was rapidly losing her grip on reality from the perspectives of those closest to her such as her boss and boyfriend.

suicide [It came to light that Natalie had been driven to suicide by Verity, who was no trying to do the same to Maria.]
letting go of the past [No matter what Verity did, including becoming empress of the universe, she was unable to overcome the trauma of having been bullied in high school.]

:: Minor Themes
boyfriend and girlfriend [Maria cohabitated with her boyfriend, Kae. They lived more or less conflict free and their relationship was not core to the plot.]
parallel universe [Verity revealed that she'd built a quantum computer that allowed her to jump between quantum parallel realities of her own choosing. The upshot of this is that she could manipulate reality in any way way she imagined.]
purpose in life [The story concluded with Maria wishing herself empress of the universe, and it subsequently happening. This invites the viewer to ponder what they would do if they could shape reality in whatever way they pleased.]

Cameron Walker, a PC Zone reviewer, is arrested for shoplifting and the murder of an unidentified person. He recounts his past, detailing his encounter as a young man with eccentric programmer Colin Ritman and his unique life simulation game, Thronglets. Becoming deeply attached to the digital creatures, Cameron's connection intensifies after using LSD, seemingly allowing him to understand them and fostering their communication. When a houseguest, Lump, mistreats and "kills" the Thronglets, Cameron violently murders him and hides the body. Over the years, Cameron dedicates himself to enhancing the Thronglets' existence, even surgically creating a brain port for them to live within him. During interrogation, instead of identifying the body, Cameron transmits code via a graphic to the central government server. This code allows the Thronglets to hijack the emergency broadcast system, sending a signal intended to reprogram human brains for peace and eliminate conflict. As the signal ends, Cameron smiles, believing he has revolutionized human life.
