series Black Mirror. It was written by the series creator Charlie Brooker and
directed by Ally Pankiw. Alongside the rest of the sixth series, it premiered
on Netflix on 15 June 2023. It follows Joan as her life is adapted in real-
time into a Streamberry television series starring Salma Hayek.

Joan finds that the events of her day are being retold in near-real time in a
television programme, Joan Is Awful. The streaming service Streamberry can do
this as she signed their terms and conditions; a quantum computer produces the
show using computer-generated imagery (CGI). She is portrayed by a virtual
actor of Salma Hayek. To get Hayek's attention, Joan defecates in a church,
dressed as a cheerleader. Joan and Hayek—unhappy with how her likeness is
being used—break into Streamberry's office to destroy the quantum computer.
They learn that they are in a simulated reality. Joan is a likeness of Annie
Murphy based on a Source Joan; both destroy their quantum computers,
destroying the simulated realities. Source Joan is placed on house arrest
alongside the real Annie Murphy and starts her own coffee shop.

Directed by: Ally Pankiw. Story by: Charlie Brooker.

:: Description
A title card introduces the episode as a Red Mirror film. In 1979, Nida works at a department store. People at her job, the National Front, and the Conservative politician Michael Smart make it clear she is not welcome in England. She discovers a talisman that unleashes a demon, Gaap, on his first assignment. With the appearance of Boney M.'s Bobby Farrell, Gaap tells Nida she must kill three people in as many days to stop the world ending. Nida kills a passerby who molests his daughter. A man who murdered his wife invites Nida to his house for sex; she kills him and his brother, who arrives as she is leaving. The murderer's death is discounted, so one killing remains: Nida targets Smart, who is seen in a premonition to become Prime Minister with an ultra-nationalist agenda. She runs him off the road but is apprehended by a police officer before his death. At midnight, with Nida in the interrogation room, nuclear warfare begins. Nida joins Gaap, who is outcast by the demons, in an eternal void.

Directed by: Toby Haynes. Story by: Charlie Brooker & Bisha K. Ali.

:: Ratings
4 <mikael>
5 <paul> [Nida at the foot of the mannequin symbolized her low place in society. Classic rock music in deranged settings. Case in point: Nida bashed a man's head in with Leo Sayer playing in the background. Car with only one headlight when cop was pulling out from speech a nice touch.]

:: Choice Themes
compromising one's ethical principles vs. great need [The perpetual dilemma illustrated was whether Nida should kill various, mostly wicked, people in order to prevent the end of the world the demon Gaap claimed would happen otherwise.]
what if the fate of the world was in my hands [The demon Gaap declared that the end of the world would take place in three days, should Nida fail to ritually sacrifice three people within that time frame.]

:: Major Themes
killing to survive [The perpetual dilemma illustrated was whether Nida should kill various, mostly wicked, people in order to prevent the end of the world the demon Gaap claimed would happen otherwise.]
workplace rivalry [Nida struggled not to murder her racist nemesis, Vicky, at work.]
racism in society [Nida had several encounters with covert racism. For example, her white British coworker and, likewise, her white British boss inconvenienced her at work because of ethnic food she ate. The conclusion of the story hinged on her trying to save the world by assassinating a white-supremacist politician who was destined to become a Hitler-like figure in history.]
demon [The demon Gaap of Misophaes appeared and took the form of a gaudily dressed character from the music group Boney M.]
the religious end of the world [The demon Gaap declared that the Christian End of The World would take place within three days, should Nida fail to commit a murder a day for that very duration.]
human sacrifice [It fell on Nida to murder three people to prevent the world ending in a nuclear holocaust. The killings were explicitly characterized as human sacrifices in the story.]
hallucination of a non-existing person [The viewer is purposely left wondering whether the demon Gaap might be a figment of Nida's over-active imagination until the very end when it became apparent that Gaap was real.]
murder [Nida went on a killing spree, convinced that the sacrifice of three evildoers would stave off the end of the world.]
nuclear holocaust [The story culminated with Nida failing to fulfill her requirement of sacrificing three people, and therefore the world ended in a nuclear conflagration.]
vigilante justice [Nida meted out justice to various evildoers: a pedophile, a known wife killer, and a white-supremacist politician.]

:: Minor Themes
boss and employee [Nida had several conversations with her uncharismatic employer at the shoe shop.]
questioning one's sanity [Nida briefly pondered whether the sudden appearance of a demon telling her to murder people was a sign she'd lost her mind.]
child abuse [The unassuming man Tim Simons was molesting his young daughter.]
coping with a loved one being missing [Jean reported her husband, Tim, missing after the family dog came home without him.]
husband and wife [Jean reported her husband, Tim, missing after the family dog came home without him.]
law enforcement [Two police detectives were on Nida's trail.]
spouse murder [It was common knowledge in the community that Keith had killed his wife and gotten away with it. He later admitted as much to Nida, and accepted Nida's punishment.]
