:: Choice Themes
working hard vs. taking it easy in life [Jonathan worked insanely hard to earn cash but then burned it all on a flashy car and then resolved never to work another day. Years later he was a bum who sorely regretted not listening to his parents' advice to work hard. Finally, in an ironic twist of fate, a lifetime of loafing about paid of for Jonathan when he found that the junk he had collected over the years was now worth a fortune as collector's items.]

:: Major Themes
legendary being [An enigmatic tree troll offered Jonathan this unsolicited life advice: Give up on going to medical school and follow your dreams.]
the value of imagination [The enigmatic tree troll was adamant that "the world needs dreamers" and "what we could truly do with (in this work) is a few more dreamers". Jonathan took the troll's world view to heart by giving up on going to medical school and becoming a dirt encrusted drifter.]
pursuing one's dream vs. advancing one's career [The story explores the consequences of Jonathan giving up on going to medical school in favor of living the free-and-easy lifestyle of a drifter.]
the desire to pursue one's dream [Jonathan gave up on going to medical school in favor of pursuing his dream of living the free-and-easy lifestyle of a drifter.]
living up to expectations [Jonathan was under pressure from his parents to go to medical school.]
carefree way of life [Jonathan took the tree troll's advice and resolved to live a life of leisure.]

:: Minor Themes
coping with a nag [In one scene, 12-year-old Jonathan was relentlessly henpecked by his mother. She guilt tripped the boy into putting his comic book down in favor of a medical textbook, and chided him for having neglected to sweep the front walk and clean his room.]
human childhood [Toward the start of the story, 12-year-old Jonathan was encouraged to give up going to medical school by an enigmatic tree troll.]
mother and son [Alma put a lot of pressure on her son, Jonathan, to go to medical school.]
father and son [Alma put a lot of pressure on his son, Jonathan, to go to medical school.]
husband and wife [Alma and Elmer Quick desperately wanted for their son, Jonathan, to go to medical school and become a doctor.]
parental disappointment in a child [Alma and Elmer were heartbroken when their son, Jonathan, revealed that he'd squandered his college tuition money on a new roadster. They summarily kicked him out of the house.]
remorse [After hitting rock bottom, Jonathan lamented not having followed his parents advice about going to medical school. He said to himself, "it took me so damn long to listen".]
contemplating suicide [After hitting rock bottom, Jonathan resolved to use what little money he had left to fill up his jalopy's gas tank and then drive off of a nearby dam to his death - thus truly hitting rock bottom.]
laziness [Jonathan's mother scolded him for being the laziest boy she ever knew. His father called him a no-good lazy bum.]

:: Major Themes
haunted house [The story centers around a married couple of ill-repute being reluctantly driven out of their new home by the good-natured ghosts of its previous owners.]
husband and wife [Tony and Sheena Sepulveda made the mistake of moving into a haunted house. The ghosts of Nelson and Evelyn Chumsky were living happily in the attic of the house that they had occupied in life - that is until the ditzy porn star Sheena and her sleazy husband, Tony, moved in. Richard and Barbara Tucker were raising their two young children in a happily haunted house.]
sex work [Sheena was a porn star. Posters for several of the XXX features that she'd starred in were pinned up in her and Tony's bedroom.] {Proposed for discussion}
old-age love [The elderly Nelson and Evelyn Chumsky kept the spark alive in their marriage, even after their deaths. They lived happily together as ghosts in the attic of the home that they'd once occupied in life.]
prudish character vs. licentious character [] {prop FD}
the desire for a simpler life [] {FD driving the plot was posthumous Chumskys' desire to rid themselves of the uncouth and uncultured couple Sheena and Tony}

:: Minor Themes
fear [In one scene, the Chumsky's scared the bejesus out of Sheena by dressing up as zombies and interrupting her bout of late night love-making with Tony.]
master and pet [Tony sicked his doberman on the Chumsky's, but to no avail as they were ghosts.]
vanity [Tony wore a wig.] {PS: In general he seemed conspicuously concerned about his appearance.}
pornography [Sheena was the poorly clad star of countless films with lewd titles. In short, she was a pornstar.] {For discussion: Sheena was somewhat stigmatized because of her chosen profession. MO@PS: Sheesh. She was vain and foolish and had picked the one profession that those attributes made her qualified for. It is alright to make fun of people who have raging character flaws. The suggestion that people of a certain gender should not be so censured is itself sexist.}

husband and wife [Merle and Samantha were worried sick about their young daughter, Dorthy, who was comatose and in danger of passing away.]
speculative ability [Ben found himself able to communicate with a comatose young girl. Ben's newfound ability was presumably bound up with himself having freshly-awoken from a coma himself.]
sacrifice for a child [In the end, Ben implored whatever it was that was threatening to carry Dorthy, a comatose young girl, off to the world beyond to take him instead. Although the exact details are never made clear, one gathers that Ben got his wish: He dropped dead and Dorthy emerged from her coma.]
