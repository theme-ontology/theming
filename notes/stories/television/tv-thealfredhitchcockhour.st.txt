what if I killed someone by accident [The novelist was charged with involuntary manslaughter after news arrived that the victim of his apparent hit-and-run had succumbed to his injuries.]
dangerous driving [Either the sports car or the motor cycle had been driven recklessly, or the hit-and-run accident at the heart of the story could not have happened.]
peer pressure [A point was made several times that some of the witnesses might be influenced to report the same as the others, despite not having witnessed all the facts first hand themselves.]

:: Major Themes
fatherly disappointment in a son [Luis disowned his only son, Al, for refusing to marry in the financial interest of the family winery. Luis humiliated Al when Al returned, desperate for money.]
gambling [The winery owner Luis put up $5000 against his teetotaler son Al's $2.40 in a contest to see who could drink who under the table. Luis, who presumably wished to humiliate Al, prevailed.]
murder [Ruth bashed Luis' head in in a jealous rage, and then left Dominic for desk in a wine cask to cover it up.]
the lust for gold [Luis was driven by a desire to expand his wine empire to the point that he disowned his only son when the son married the woman he loved, rather than the heiress of a rival winery.]
husband and wife [Al and Jeanne Aguilar attended Al's father's lavish house party.] {PS: Hard to justify this as major.}
coping with a loved one being in peril [The policeman George Felse was particularly troubled over the unexplained disappearance of his son, Dominic.]
law enforcement [The policeman George Felse was investigating Luis' suspicious death.] {PS: borderline}
facing financial ruin [Al came crawling to his wealthy father for money, but to no avail.]
infatuation [Dominic had a teenage crush on the beautiful winery heiress, Kitty Norris.] {MO@LM: unrequited love, no?}
unrequited love [Ruth had been besotted with Luis for a long time and expected him to marry her, but then he suddenly made it clear that he would do no such thing and, in fact, that he want to marry someone else.]
hell hath no fury like a woman scorned [As Luis made it clear that hell would freeze over sooner than he would make good on his promise to marry Ruth, she summarily bashed his head in with a magnum wine bottle, tried to murder young Dominic who was a witness, and then attempted suicide with sleeping pills (prompting us to wonder why she bothered to torment Dominic so first).]

:: Minor Themes

what if I became witness to a crime [The plot hinges on Loren witnessing a couple of car thieves murder their partner with a tire iron.]
teen romance [The teens Loren and Pete fell for each other during the course of their pursuit and captivity at the hands of criminals. The story concluded with Loren kissing a bashful Pete on the cheek, and inviting him to visit her in England next summer.] {MO@LM: there was a suggestive spark there but seems a bit much to call this major to me, no?}
facing organized pursuit [After witnessing a murder, Loren was pursued across parts of Mexico and the South Western by the killers.] {PS: Organized enough? MO: IMHO: no, the police refused to get involved so it was just two men in a car (her parents didn't do much but visit the police station, foolishly trusting the authorities)}
what if a killer was after me [Loren was being chased by men she knew did not shy from murder.]
corruption in society [It transpires that the local police in both of the towns that were visited were either wholly or somewhat corrupt.]

:: Minor Themes
theft [A pair of car thieves made off with a station wagon, not knowing a 17-year-old girl was fast asleep in the back seat.]
coping with unwelcome romantic attention [Two young Mexican men responded to Loren's pleas for help with wolf-whistling and crass romantic overtures in broken English.]

:: Major Themes
blackmail [Consuela blackmailed Dianne by threatening to reveal that she had been drunk, negligent and in charge of the baby when the baby tragically drowned.]
alcohol abuse [Dianne was a text book alcoholic who had convinced her husband she had quit but, in fact, carried on drinking like a fish anyway.]
coping with the death of a child [Dianne and Consuela were both coping or feigning to cope with the death of their baby son who drowned tragically in the pool.]
husband and wife [Dianne and Victor.]
con artistry [The simple blackmail story escalated into something much more elaborate when Consuela decided to stay on, use tricks to drive Dianne into anxiety and boozing, have Dianne committed, presumably divorced, and to try and steal Dianne's husband.]
the lust for gold [Pedro complained in the end that he and Consuela had merely wanted to exhort $10-20,000 from Dianne and skedaddle together but then Consuela had gotten greedy for $5,000,000 (which MO assumes is what Lance was said to be worth, but missed it if so) and the beautiful house.] {PS: Pedro said she was "greedy for 5 million dollars and this house".}
remorse [Dianne was evidently tortured by the fact that her toddler drown owing to her negligence.] {MO@PS I leave this one to you but it seems like remorse was expressed by both Dianne and Lance}
master and servant [Central to the drama was Dianne and her perfidious servant Pedro Sanchez who betrayed her secret and tried to blackmail her.]
coping with someone having an addiction [Victor supported his wife, Dianne, who was struggling with alcoholism.]
romantic love [Victor's love for his problem drinking wife, Dianna, was steadfast. He twice proclaimed his love to her.]
lying [Dianne ultimately came clean to her husband on a doozie of a lie: Their toddler drown owing to her negligence, not through the fault of the nanny, as was determined at the inquest.]

:: Minor Themes
human self improvement [Dianne had tried to quit drinking, and had in fact cut down significantly when they got the baby.] {MO: we don't have a specific theme about giving up alcohol, do we? worth having? PS: I see we have "overcoming an addiction". Whatever we do, knock up?}
master and servant [Dianne's nanny took the fall after Dianne's negligence caused the death of her baby.]
taking the blame for someone else's crime [Dianne's nanny took the fall, lying at the inquest, after Dianne's negligence caused the death of her baby.] {MO: The inquest in the story judged this non-criminal negligence, but I say from a thematical viewpoint it is nevertheless close enough. The nanny lied at an inquest and that must be obstruction of justice.}
unrequited love [Victor was loved Consuela, but she loved only money according to him.]
inebriated interaction [Dianne made a drunken scene at the cocktail party.] {PS: We started using a different theme for this situation, but couldn't find it.}
coping with a drunken fool [Victor was mortified by his drunken wife's behavior at the cocktail party.]
religious occupation [Dianne visited a Catholic nun about adopting another baby.]

meeting between them in hopes that her husband would kill George. The stranger
tells George that she has done this sort of thing before and that he tried,
but failed, to kill his wife's last lover. The stranger convinces George to
plot revenge and tells him to tamper with the steering of his wife's car.
George does as the stranger suggests and his girlfriend dies. George discovers
to his dismay, however, that the limping stranger was really his girlfriend's
former lover and that he used George to get his revenge on her.
