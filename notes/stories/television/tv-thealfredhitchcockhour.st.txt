dangerous driving [Either the sports car or the motor cycle had been driven recklessly, or the hit-and-run accident at the heart of the story could not have happened.]
peer pressure [A point was made several times that some of the witnesses might be influenced to report the same as the others, despite not having witnessed all the facts first hand themselves.]

Jim betrayed Mr. Harney by pretending to carry out the assassination for which he was contracted, and collecting the money, without actually offing the mark.]
the hitman profession [The story features an idea of what working as a professional assassin in contemporary America might have been like. It also compares and contrasts two self-styled hitmen, one of whom ended up administering the other a sound thrashing.]
remorse [Eddie felt regret over having caused Connie the injury that landed her in a wheelchair and tried to make amends by pilfering money to get her an operation.]
domestic violence [It was a little murky how Connie had actually ended up in the wheelchair. First we heard that Eddie had beaten her with his belt. Later we heard that it was the result of a somewhat mutual kerfuffle during which she had accidentally fallen down the stairs. Either way: the two had been physically fighting.]

:: Title
Starring the Defense

:: Date

:: Description
A former actor defends his son on murder charges.

Directed by: Joseph Pevney. Story by: Henry Slesar.

:: Ratings

5 <mikael>

:: Choice Themes
persuasion of groups by rhetoric [As pointedly alluded to in the title, Miles and Ed had an argument about whether Miles mustering his divine acting abilities and fatherly faith in his son to deliver an impassioned appeal could sway the jury despite the fact that there was not a shred of supporting evidence favoring their case. After Miles made his (rather theatrical) closing remarks it was revealed that he had lifted it verbatim from an old movie, and the ethics of doing so was explicitly discussed.]

:: Major Themes
what it is like in a legal proceeding [The whole story centered on the actor turned lawyer Miles Crawford defending his son on a murder charge in a court of law.]
father and son [The whole story centered on the former actor Miles Crawford defending his son, Tod, on a murder charge in a court of law.]
murder [Tod was tried for and ultimately found guilty of murder over having dispatched a friend/rival in a knife fight.]
the legal professions [The story follows a lawyer in his efforts to influence a jury to rule in the favor of his client, who also happen to be his son.]
neglectful parent [Miles was beating himself up because he thought his son Tod's now delinquent behavior was down to Miles not spending enough time with him when they were younger.]
remorse [Miles was remorseful over having been too busy studying to become a lawyer to properly raise his son, Tod. He blamed him self for Tod's delinquency, and tried to take a step toward mending things by representing his son in court.]
beating one's self up [Miles confided in his old friend Sam that it was his own fault that Tod had turned out as he did.]
male-male rivalry [The story explores the aftermath of Tod killing his frenemy Jules, stemming from their rivalry over Babs Riordan.]
mercy [The story pointedly ended with Miles swaying the judge into taking mercy on Tod by sparing him the death penalty. The judge instead sentenced Tod to life in prison with the possibility of parole, citing that Tod might still become a valuable member of society.]
acting [A main novelty of the story is the former movie star Miles Crawford exploiting of his supreme acting ability to sway the jury in his son's murder trial.]
guilt and evidence [Tod had been provoked into a knife fight with a "friend" whom he had a somewhat complicated relationship with. Tod ended up killing the friend and was charged with first degree murder. The story discusses whether and to what extent Tod perhaps ought to be charged with, for example, second degree murder, manslaughter, or let off on self-defense instead. In light of the fact, as a witness told it, that he did not instigate the fight it might indeed seem rather harsh to the viewer to convict him of premeditated murder. The judge seemed to agree that there were plenty of mitigating circumstances, in the end, even though he upheld the guilty verdict delivered by the jury.]

:: Minor Themes
master and servant [Miles' maid announced the presence of his old friend, Sam.]
friendship [Sam paid his old friend, Miles, an evening visit. They conversed and played gin rummy until things took a serious turn when Miles' son returned home in a highly distressed state of mind.]
tabletop games [Miles got the better of Sam at gin rummy.]
law enforcement [The cops collected Tod for questioning in the stabbing death of his friend and rival, Jules. Tod was soon after charged with first-degree murder.]
father and daughter [The high-profile defense attorney Ed Rutherford was less than impressed with his young daughter Ruthie's performance as his secretary.]
facing one's own execution [In the movie that was shown to the judge, the condemned man lost his nerve on the way to the electric chair.]
capital punishment [Presumably swayed by the dramatic scene of a man's execution as shown in a movie, the judge spared Tod the death penalty, choosing instead to sentence him to life in prison with the possibility of parole.]
the religious professions [In the movie that was shown to the judge, a man of the cloth led the condemned man's walk to the death chamber.]

:: Major Themes
roommate and roommate [The plot turns on Doc Carrol trying to teach his out-of-control roommate Skip Baxter a lesson by planting a cadaver in their room, but the plan backfired.]
alcohol abuse [Skip Baxter overindulged in the giggle juice to an insane degree. He often did often did not remember events from the night before, like when he dunked a girl in the shower or when he was set up with the presumed murder.]
practical joking [Mr. Carroll was berated by the professor after he scared the bejesus out of the female students by posing as a cadaver and "coming to life" in the middle of an anatomy class. He later tried to put his talents in this same area to a more philanthropic use when he staged a murder in order to make his roommate give up the alcohol said roommate was badly abusing.]
murder [The plot tuns on a passed out drunk Skip being tricked by his roommate, Terry, into thinking that he'd murdered a waitress in a drunken rage. When the truth finally came to light, Skip lost his mind and legitimately murdered Terry.]
what if I killed someone by accident [Skip woke up to discover that he'd apparently murdered a waitress in a drunken rage.]
what it is like in university [The viewer is shown an idea of what kind of antics went down in a 1960s-era dormitory for male medical students.]
poetic justice [Though arguably taken a few steps too far, it seems a point of the story was that Doc Carrol having played around with cadavers to fool people once too many times finally ended up a cadaver himself because of it.]

:: Minor Themes
brother and brother [In the closing sketch, Alfred Hitchcock was disappeared behind a wall of ivy thorough the designs of his dastardly, mustachioed brother.]
coping with a drunken fool [Skip made a drunken ass of himself on at least two occasions.]
coping with a bad hangover [Skip complained of having a terrible hangover after waking up from a night of binge drinking.]
famine [Mrs. Fister rambled about being depressed by reports of famine in the world.]
coping with an obnoxious chatterbox [Skip's patience was sorely tested by Mrs. Fister's endless rambling.]
American football [Skip was cut from the football team for missing too many classes.]
remembrance [Mrs. Fister fondly reminisced about her late husband and, in particular, how he'd tinker in the garage.]

claustrophobia [Terry struggled with his fear of being in confined spaces, which stemmed from the time he spent in solitary confinement at the penitentiary.]
romantic love [Terry and Carol's burgeoning love ended badly when Terry was apprehended by the authorities on a very serious charge.]
the dangers of radioactivity [The plot turns on a trio of ex-cons opening a container of radioactive cobalt that they'd inadvertently stolen. The radiation from the exposed cobalt posed a danger to the local community.]
burglary [The ex-convict Fred Kruger masterminded a daring burglary of an industrial warehouse. Little did he and his two accomplices know that the purloined safe contained a sample of radioactive cobalt-60 in addition to the cash they coveted.]
law enforcement [The FBI and local authorities were on the tail of Fred and his accomplices.]
betrayal [Fred betrayed his two partners in crime, Terry and Al, each in turn because his respective weakness threatened to give the game away to the police.]
compassion [Terry almost gave the game away to the police because he was so concerned both for his love interest, Carol, and for other innocent bystanders (in particular a group of children that would be passing nearby) who risked being exposed to deadly radiation.]
coping with radiation sickness [Al freaked out and went to the hospital after sticking his finger into a highly radioactive cobalt container. Carol and her father, Otto, felt under the weather because of radiation from the cobalt-60, which, unbeknownst to them, sit exposed in the building next door. Carol's pet bird died from the cobalt-60 radiation. There were lots of concerns about the effects the radiation would have on the local community.]

:: Minor Themes
collecting objects [In his sketch, Alfred Hitchcock, sitting in a bank vault surrounded by bags of money with dollar signs on them, announced his new hobby to the viewers: coin collecting.]
human childhood [Little Jimmy high tailed it from the local store without having paid for the monster mask he was wearing.]

:: Choice Themes
spouse murder [As alluded to in the title, the story concerns spouse murder albeit in a more than usually confounded way: Gerald convinced his disagreeable wife, Edith, that he was planning to murder her. But this was all a ruse to provoke her into making an attempt on his own life under circumstances that would see her imprisoned.]

:: Major Themes
coping with a nag [Edith nagged Gerald to an insane degree. One neighbor said Edith was liable to drive Gerald to suicide.]
shrew character [Edith was an unpleasant, ill-tempered woman characterized by scolding, nagging, and aggression to a notable degree. Many of her neighbors testified, more or less, to that effect.]
suicide [Rather than allowing him to leave in the morning, Edith poisoned Gerald's hot cocoa and made out that he had attempted to kill himself. One neighbor said Edith was liable to drive Gerald to suicide.]
husband and wife [Gerald and Edith Swinney.]
hell hath no fury like a woman scorned [It would seem the final drop that drove Edith to murder, was the revelation that Gerald had resolved to up and leave her in the morning no matter what she said.]
resentment [Years of marriage presumably left Gerald and Edith bitter and resentful toward one another.]
coping with a failing marriage [Gerald and Edith's marriage was in shambles. Gerald, a mild-mannered man, wanted out but his cartoonishly overbearing wife refused to grant him a divorce.]
poison murder [Edith laced Gerald's hot cocoa with a lethal dose of rat poison. Little did she know that he was one step ahead of her, and dumped the drink in a trophy.]

divorce [Edith blankly refused to let Gerald have a divorce and she made it clear that she knew her rights.]
blackmail [Gerald almost had it made, in the end, when he was confronted by an unattractive woman from whom he bought the rats with which he had tricked his ex-wife. The rat peddler blackmailed him into starting a relationship with her, we gather.]
fishing [Edith callously disposed of Gerald's fishing equipment, containing flies that he'd spent hours tying, without his permission.]

:: Major Themes
gold digging [Raymond married four different women for the stated reason of both love and money. It was carefully noted that the women in question were worth between $18,000-$40,000 each at the time, and that Raymond needed this money to support his gambling.]
husband and wife [The bigamist Raymond Brown and his four wives (Bernice, Lucille, Marion, and an unnamed spouse).] {MO: was the forth one never shown or is she uncredited or what? I lost count. PS: Three named ones by my count}
law enforcement [Raymond dealt with two different police detectives that investigated the respective murders of two of his wives.]
romantic love [Marion and Raymond variously spoke about love and its importance. The other wives also explained that they loved Raymond more or less unreservedly.] {PS: we have "matrimonial love" - but do we want to bother with it anymore?}
poison murder [Marion killed Raymond's other wives, by means of cyanide in the hooch, because she wanted him to herself.]
romantic jealousy [Even when she found out that she herself was not Raymond's first wife, and that she was therefore a husband-stealer and a hypocrite, Marion did not let up. She murdered Raymond's other wives because she could not stand to share him, nor to loose him.]

gambling [Raymond gambled a lot, we learned. He had hired a man to make bets for him.] {MO: note that there was no evidence in the story, as far as I could tell, that the gambling had caused any life-troubles so "problem gambling" can't seem to be justified. PS: agree}

Keith seduced and married Grace by convincing her he was not after her fortune and that they would move to Bolivia together. Then he faked his own death. In despair, she almost gave her entire fortune to the mystic so that she could have a few supernatural moments with Keith's ghost.]

:: Major Themes
gold digging [It turned out that Keith was a conman who was only interested in the heiress Grace for her vast fortune. Grace's ex-husband, her chauffeur (?), had proven himself to be a gold digger Grace explained. Divorcing him had cost $100k.] {MO: gold digging is topical, but I point out that Keith had a ridiculous and overly convoluted scheme to con her out of her money that involved proving he was not a gold digger and faking his own death. We should perhaps clarify.}
romantic love [The heiress Grace found the love of her life in Keith, but was devastated when confronted with the inconvenient truth that he was nothing but a fortune hunting conman.]
fiancée and fiancée [Grace and Keith became engaged following a short courtship.] {PS: I discovered this should be "fiancé and fiancée" or vice versa}

séance [Grace turned to the mystic Dr. Shankara in an effort to contact her apparently deceased fiancé Keith from beyond the grave.]
master and servant [The elderly servant woman Minnie was like a mother to the heiress Grace. Grace briefly interacted with her butler, Charles.]
betrayal [The story culminated with the heiress Grace realizing that the love of her life, Keith, was nothing but a fortune hunter who'd been conning her all along.] {PS: We might introduce a child theme of this one to cover someone betraying their lover; a parallel to "false friend". MO: I guess that's pretty much implied by "gold digging" as defined? Also we don't usually use "betrayal" for cons - I guess you add it here because you want to drive home again that the boundaries aren't clear. I don't have the answer. Maybe skim con artistry and related themes and add it.}
ignorance is bliss [The story pointedly culminates with Grace shooting her trusted servant dead for shattering her illusion about the fidelity of her husband's love.] {MO: I don't know what to make of it - I guess she went nuts because it made no sense to me. But I found a better theme, I think, see below.}
coping with life issues [] {PS: placeholder to discuss about introducing a theme to cover the Henry V trope from Shakespeare where someone of renown needs to hide their true identity to know the truth of things}
the inclination to believe what one wants to believe [Grace point blank refused to believe the truth about her beloved Keith even when she was shown evidence by the police that he was a crook. Deranged, she went so far as to shoot her trusted servant dead because she blamed her for reasons that seemingly make no sense to the viewer.]
fear of commitment [] {FD: Grace was afraid of entering into relationships because she had been screwed over by her ex-husband. Therefore she went through pains to masquerade as a poor girl even though she was immensely rich. MO: should this also parent to "fear" perhaps? (not sure what I think)}

:: Minor Themes
romantic courtship [Grace and Keith engaged in a brief courtship prior to Keith popping the question.]
poetry [Keith read aloud the opening line from Christina Rosetti's narrative poem A Ballad Of Boding: "There are sleeping dreams and waking dreams; What seems is not always as it seems". He later read the line "Beyond the sea of death love lies For ever" from the Rosetti's poem One Day.]

extramarital affair [Roy couldn't stand idly by and let Marcia, at least in his view, destroy the lives of her husband and young stepson with her adulterous lifestyle. He saw in her her and Stevie, himself and his stepmother, whom he blamed for whatever had gone wrong in his life.] {MO: I mean sure "in his view" is technically correct, but you must agree that reflected widely accepted family values in the 60s America, so it seems like rather excessive ass-covering on our part. If you want to delineate what was really wrong here from a gender-perspective, I would say that it was Roy's willingness to use violence (breaking and entering and manhandling) to assert his views, which of course was as wrong then as it is now, although it was probably lost on many 60s viewers who (with their archaic family values) might have felt that Marcia's offense outweighed Roy's by a yard and a mile.}

neglectful parent [The viewer is led to think that Roy befriended the youngster Stevie because Roy was some kind of "kook". In the end, Roy revealed his actions were motivated by a desire to save Stevie from the same fate Roy had suffered as a boy. According to Roy, his stepmother neglected him as a boy by choosing adultery over mothering him. Roy, who came to learn that Marcia was having an affair, sympathized with Stevie and ultimately admonished Marcia for her neglecting the boy.]
dysfunctional upbringing [Roy was upset about the way Marcia treated her step-son, Stevie, because he recognized in their situation that of his own earlier childhood, which we understand was none too happy. Roy and Stevie conversed briefly about how they both had "moved around a lot".]

social ethical dilemma [Lucy raised this past moral controversy: Did Marcia invite the peeping Tom by wearing skimpy clothes?] {MO: we tend to prefer putting things as sociocultural issues nowadays I think, if they are not clear-cut ethical dilemmas... and women are still being blamed for provoking sexual assaults, especially if you look at some Arab backwaters.}
law enforcement [A man in blue took down Marcia report about a peeping Tom.]
human childhood [The youngster Stevie engaged played with his gas-powered, tethered toy airplane in the park.]

gold digging [Adelaide married Edward for his fortune. This was after she's already been scamming him as part of her false medium racket.]
descent into madness [Edward gradually lost his over the tragic passing of his son, John, in the war. In the end, he took the life of his wife and then himself, thinking they'd be reunited with his son in the afterlife.]
poetic justice [] {FD: this is another case of "I knows it when I sees it" I think - she was an evildoer and her evil somehow lead straight to her own undoing. Maybe time to adjust the theme definition, but how?}
hubris [] {FD just a placeholder because it strikes me there's a moral here that is embodied in a pithy Swedish aphorism but I can't think of a good English equivalent. Basically "if you try to bite off more than you can chew, often you end up losing it all" because Adelaide could have contented herself with petty graft from various clients as her partner wanted, but she couldn't resist the marriage proposal even though she knew it was an idiotic risk because she was simply too greedy}

:: Major Themes
yokel stereotype [The viewer is shown some stereotypical country bumpkins in a rural setting.]
husband and wife [Charlie and Thedy Sue Hill. The story explores how Charlie and Thedy's marriage is derailed by Thedy's infidelity coupled with the added stressor of a mysterious new jar that becomes the talk of the town.]
extramarital affair [Thedy Sue was carrying on a barely concealed affair with Tom Carmody.]
love triangle [Thedy was running around with Tom in what she presumed to be behind her husband Charlie's back.] {MO: alternatively, "Thedy Sue carried on shamelessly with Tom Carmody right under her husband's nose."}
the need to be treated with respect [Central to the story was lowly Charlie using the spellbinding jar he purchased at a carnival to become the talk of the town, and the ongoing center of attention. People now ventured from afar to visit his humble shack, and he would even plan for serving refreshments.]
the desire for fame [Central to the story was lowly Charlie using the spellbinding jar he purchased at a carnival to become the talk of the town.]
the desire for prestige [] {PS: Finally merge with "the need to be treated with respect"?}
theft [Charlie was up in arms after an unknown burglar, later revealed to be Jahdoo commissioned by Tom for a dollar, made off with Charlie's precious jar.] {PS: borderline}
spouse murder [The story ended with Charlie being outed for killing his wife and putting her severed head on display in a jar.]
humans in group [] {For discussion: Can't quite put my finder on it, but there's something afoot about everyone getting into a fervor over the jar and everyone seeing what they want to see it in. "pluralistic ignorance" doesn't seem quite right. MO: I don't think it is about "humans in groups" so much as an individual "person and mystery jar" experience.. so I say look for themes related to imagination or power of belief or whatever}
the human capacity for good and evil [] {PS: I found this mentioned in the Cliff's Notes MO: hmm, this is too subtle for a bumpkin like me but from the Cliff's notes I guess it's more akin to "good and evil in religion"}
young and old romance [There was a marked age difference between Charlie and his younger wife, Thedy Sue, which probably explains why she ran around with a younger man under her husband's nose and why he didn't do anything about it.]
the value of imagination [] {FD it's vague like in all Baradbury stories, but it clearly gave the people a lot of joy to sit and ponder what might be in the jar. The mutterings indicated it dragged up old memories of things that were important to them.}

:: Minor Themes
genie [In his closing remarks, Alfred Hitchcock feigned to have encountered an angry genie inside the oversized bottle out of which he'd recently escaped.]
facing a home invader [In his closing remarks, Alfred Hitchcock remarked that the angry genie in question accused Alfred of having broken into its novelty, oversized bottle.]  
law enforcement [Instead of chasing down Tom to issue him a speeding ticket, Sheriff Clem plucked himself down in front of the general store, half-heartedly assuring those there that he's get Tom the next day. Charlie went to the Sheriff Clem to demand that the brazen theft of his much coveted jar be investigated without delay.]
dangerous driving [Instead of chasing down Tom to issue him a speeding ticket, Sheriff Clem plucked himself down in front of the general store, half-heartedly assuring those there that he's get Tom the next day.]
mental retardation [The town dullard Juke had the mind of a 10-year-old (according to Juke's physician as reported by Juke).]
remorse [Juke expressed sorry over having drowned a kitten in his youth.]
jealous [Charlie insinuated that Tom was jealous of him over his newfound fame.]
mother and daughter [The little girl Eve Ann attended the jar viewing together with hr mother.]
monster [The little girl Eve Ann speculated the the bogeyman himself was contained inside the jar.]
hominid evolution [Jahdoo, after purloining the magic jar and mounting it on a log in his swamp, explained that he knew precisely what it contained. Allegedly it was the precursor to modern day human, and something that had (sic) both evolved out of the bamboo forests and crawled onto land about 10,000 years ago (perhaps we were not meant to take his poetic ramblings literally, but the general meaning was evident).]
