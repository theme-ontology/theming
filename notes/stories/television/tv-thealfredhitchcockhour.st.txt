Directed by: Bernard Girard. Story by: Alfred Hayes.

3 <mikael> [-1 because it beggars belief that any gambler would put themself at the mercy of hoodlums who simply turn to violence if they lose.]

:: Choice Themes

:: Major Themes
problem gambling [The story follows the successful investment counselor and compulsive gambler Duke Marsden as he takes it upon himself to teach his younger brother, Chuck, that a life of gambling isn't all rainbows and sunshine.]
brother and brother [The story follows Duke as he tries to teach his younger brother, and fellow problem gambler, Chuck, a lesson about the dangers in following in his footsteps.]
husband and wife [After consenting to Alice's ultimatum to stop his gambling, Duke and Alice patched up their marriage, and resolved to go on vacation in Hawaii. Things went awry, however, when Duke decided there was one last poker night he needed to attend.]
coping with a failing marriage [Alice was on the verge of divorcing Duke because of his compulsive gambling, but their tried to patch things up after he agreed to her ultimatum to quit.] {PS: Make a child of "husband and wife"?}
cheating [In the end, Duke was dramatically revealed to have been using marked cards at the poker table, and lost his life for having done so. Earlier, another gambler, Alley, had also been shot for dealing from the bottom of the deck.]
lesson in humility [Chuck was taught a lesson about the dangers of a life of gambling.]
obsession [Duke's obsession with gambling, which he sort of referred to, was nearly the end of his marriage. He also pointed out that every gambler died broke, and he sought to save his younger brother from that fate.]
sacrifice for a loved one [Duke understood the risk he was taking, both to his person and his marriage, by trying to save his little brother.]
you have to take chances to get ahead [The argument between Duke and Chuck essentially boiled down to this: Duke did not think it was worth taking the risks of gambling to get ahead, but Chuck saw that he could never achieve the affluence Duke had otherwise, and begged to differ.]

:: Minor Themes
master and servant [Duke's trusty manservant, who was in a neck brace for no apparent reason, delivered to him the marked deck of cards.]
boss and employee [Duke's secretary gave him a head's up that his wife was planning to leave him.]
divorce [Alice threatened to divorce Duke.]
brother-in-law and sister-in-law [Alice exchanged pleasantries with her husband's younger brother, Chuck.]
sexism in society [AH made a quip about "key clubs" being terribly exclusive in that they cater only to men.]
narcissism [AH obliquely implied that he himself ranked among the highest things a female can desire when he said that everything they could want, namely himself, was to be found in his key club.]
rich character vs. poor character [Duke and Chuck had had a dirt poor upbringing and were contrasted with their respective love interests, both whom were described as having been born with a silver spoon in their mouth.]

young motorcyclist.

Directed by: Alfred Hitchcock. Story by: Henry Cecil (story), Henry Slesar
(teleplay).

:: Ratings
4 <mikael> [+1 because a point is cleverly made about witness unreliability]
2 <paul> [Good premise, tedious delivery. They would have done better to explore how prejudices shape perceptions in the context of an electrocuted pachyderm, not a hit-and-run accident. Great early 60s teen party toward the end.]

:: Choice Themes

:: Major Themes
creative writing [The protagonist was a crime fiction writer by profession, and said that this was a reason he wanted to be is own defense council.]
husband and wife [The novelist was concerned for his wife, who was about to give birth in the hospital. Indeed, it is revealed that he was taking the blame in a hit-and-run accident for her.]
obstruction of justice [The novelist took the blame for his wife in order to protect her from the stress of a trial. The judge threatened the novelist with being held in contempt of court for refusing to answer questions while on the witness stand.]
what it is like in a legal proceeding [The story featured a relatively compelling rendition of what might have gone on in a courtroom somewhere in 1960s America.]
what if I killed someone by accident [The novelist was charged with involuntary manslaughter after news arrived that the victim of his apparent hit-and-run had succumbed to his injuries.]
dangerous driving [Either the sports car or the motor cycle had been driven recklessly, or the hit-and-run accident at the heart of the story could not have happened.]
peer pressure [A point was made several times that some of the witnesses might be influenced to report the same as the others, despite not having witnessed all the facts first hand themselves.]
the inclination to believe what one wants to believe [All of the witnesses were apparently sincere, but some may simply have convinced themselves that they saw what they wanted to have seen. The army man wanted to convict a sports car driver because such a driver had killed his three year old son. A young woman had changed her testimony in the novelist's favor after she came to credit the novelist with indirectly having saved her from putting up her baby for adoption.]
sacrifice for a loved one [In the end it was revealed that the novelist had been taking the blame in order to protect his pregnant and excitable wife.]
the legal professions [There were a judge and a prosecutor in the courtroom.]

:: Minor Themes
sexism in society [In his sketch, a giant, novelty key holding Alfred Hitchcock proudly spoke of his female only private club in a jab at male only "key clubs".]
alcohol abuse [The local barfly Mr. Peterson made some self-deprecating remarks about his problem drinking while on the witness stand to the great amusement of the courtroom spectators.]
divorce [Mrs. Dowling revealed to the judge that she divorced after a short marriage and had considered putting her baby up for adoption.]
