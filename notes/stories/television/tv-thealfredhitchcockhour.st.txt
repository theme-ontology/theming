domestic violence [It was a little murky how Connie had actually ended up in the wheelchair. First we heard that Eddie had beaten her with his belt.

:: Title
Starring the Defense

:: Date

:: Description
A former actor defends his son on murder charges.

Directed by: Joseph Pevney. Story by: Henry Slesar.

:: Ratings
4 <paul>
5 <mikael>

:: Choice Themes
persuasion of groups by rhetoric [As pointedly alluded to in the title, Miles and Ed had an argument about whether Miles mustering his divine acting abilities and fatherly faith in his son to deliver an impassioned appeal could sway the jury despite the fact that there was not a shred of supporting evidence favoring their case. After Miles made his (rather theatrical) closing remarks it was revealed that he had lifted it verbatim from an old movie, and the ethics of doing so was explicitly discussed.]

:: Major Themes
what it is like in a legal proceeding [The whole story centered on the actor turned lawyer Miles Crawford defending his son on a murder charge in a court of law.]
father and son [The whole story centered on the former actor Miles Crawford defending his son, Tod, on a murder charge in a court of law.]
murder [Tod was tried for and ultimately found guilty of murder over having dispatched a friend/rival in a knife fight.]
legal occupation [The story follows a lawyer in his efforts to influence a jury to rule in the favor of his client, who also happen to be his son.]
neglectful parent [Miles was beating himself up because he thought his son Tod's now delinquent behavior was down to Miles not spending enough time with him when they were younger.]
remorse [Miles was remorseful over having been too busy studying to become a lawyer to properly raise his son, Tod. He blamed him self for Tod's delinquency, and tried to take a step toward mending things by representing his son in court.]
beating one's self up [Miles confided in his old friend Sam that it was his own fault that Tod had turned out as he did.]
male-male rivalry [The story explores the aftermath of Tod killing his frenemy Jules, stemming from their rivalry over Babs Riordan.]
mercy [The story pointedly ended with Miles swaying the judge into taking mercy on Tod by sparing him the death penalty. The judge instead sentenced Tod to life in prison with the possibility of parole, citing that Tod might still become a valuable member of society.]
acting [A main novelty of the story is the former movie star Miles Crawford exploiting of his supreme acting ability to sway the jury in his son's murder trial.]
guilt and evidence [Tod had been provoked into a knife fight with a "friend" whom he had a somewhat complicated relationship with. Tod ended up killing the friend and was charged with first degree murder. The story discusses whether and to what extent Tod perhaps ought to be charged with, for example, second degree murder, manslaughter, or let off on self-defense instead. In light of the fact, as a witness told it, that he did not instigate the fight it might indeed seem rather harsh to the viewer to convict him of premeditated murder. The judge seemed to agree that there were plenty of mitigating circumstances, in the end, even though he upheld the guilty verdict delivered by the jury.]

:: Minor Themes
master and servant [Miles' maid announced the presence of his old friend, Sam.]
friendship [Sam paid his old friend, Miles, an evening visit. They conversed and played gin rummy until things took a serious turn when Miles' son returned home in a highly distressed state of mind.]
tabletop games [Miles got the better of Sam at gin rummy.]
law enforcement [The cops collected Tod for questioning in the stabbing death of his friend and rival, Jules. Tod was soon after charged with first-degree murder.]
father and daughter [The high-profile defense attorney Ed Rutherford was less than impressed with his young daughter Ruthie's performance as his secretary.]
facing one's own execution [In the movie that was shown to the judge, the condemned man lost his nerve on the way to the electric chair.]
capital punishment [Presumably swayed by the dramatic scene of a man's execution as shown in a movie, the judge spared Tod the death penalty, choosing instead to sentence him to life in prison with the possibility of parole.]
religious occupation [In the movie that was shown to the judge, a man of the cloth led the condemned man's walk to the death chamber.]

:: Major Themes
roommate and roommate [The plot turns on Doc Carrol trying to teach his out-of-control roommate Skip Baxter a lesson by planting a cadaver in their room, but the plan backfired.]
alcohol abuse [Skip Baxter overindulged in the giggle juice to an insane degree. He often did often did not remember events from the night before, like when he dunked a girl in the shower or when he was set up with the presumed murder.]
practical joking [Mr. Carroll was berated by the professor after he scared the bejesus out of the female students by posing as a cadaver and "coming to life" in the middle of an anatomy class. He later tried to put his talents in this same area to a more philanthropic use when he staged a murder in order to make his roommate give up the alcohol said roommate was badly abusing.]
murder [The plot tuns on a passed out drunk Skip being tricked by his roommate, Terry, into thinking that he'd murdered a waitress in a drunken rage. When the truth finally came to light, Skip lost his mind and legitimately murdered Terry.]
what if I killed someone by accident [Skip woke up to discover that he'd apparently murdered a waitress in a drunken rage.]
what it is like in university [The viewer is shown an idea of what kind of antics went down in a 1960s-era dormitory for male medical students.]
poetic justice [Though arguably taken a few steps too far, it seems a point of the story was that Doc Carrol having played around with cadavers to fool people once too many times finally ended up a cadaver himself because of it.]

:: Minor Themes
brother and brother [In the closing sketch, Alfred Hitchcock was disappeared behind a wall of ivy thorough the designs of his dastardly, mustachioed brother.]
coping with a drunken fool [Skip made a drunken ass of himself on at least two occasions.]
coping with a bad hangover [Skip complained of having a terrible hangover after waking up from a night of binge drinking.]
famine [Mrs. Fister rambled about being depressed by reports of famine in the world.]
coping with an obnoxious chatterbox [Skip's patience was sorely tested by Mrs. Fister's endless rambling.]
American football [Skip was cut from the football team for missing too many classes.]
remembrance [Mrs. Fister fondly reminisced about her late husband and, in particular, how he'd tinker in the garage.]

burglary [The ex-convict Fred Kruger masterminded a daring burglary of an industrial warehouse. Little did he and his two accomplices know that the purloined safe contained a sample of radioactive cobalt-60 in addition to the cash they coveted.]
law enforcement [The FBI and local authorities were on the tail of Fred and his accomplices.]
betrayal [Fred betrayed his two partners in crime, Terry and Al, each in turn because his respective weakness threatened to give the game away to the police.]
compassion [Terry almost gave the game away to the police because he was so concerned both for his love interest, Carol, and for other innocent bystanders (in particular a group of children that would be passing nearby) who risked being exposed to deadly radiation.]
coping with radiation sickness [Al freaked out and went to the hospital after sticking his finger into a highly radioactive cobalt container. Carol and her father, Otto, felt under the weather because of radiation from the cobalt-60, which, unbeknownst to them, sit exposed in the building next door. Carol's pet bird died from the cobalt-60 radiation. There were lots of concerns about the effects the radiation would have on the local community.]

spouse murder [As alluded to in the title, the story concerns spouse murder albeit in a more than usually confounded way: Gerald convinced his disagreeable wife, Edith, that he was planning to murder her.

coping with the death of a spouse [A theme alluded to in the title: Grace was devastated after her beloved fianc√© Keith apparently died in a mining accident. She descended into madness and ended up shooting her loyal servant dead rather than face the truth that her Keith was a conman.]
con artistry [Keith and Dr. Shankara, a mystic, tried to swindle the heiress Grace out of her fortune. Keith seduced and married Grace by convincing her he was not after her fortune and that they would move to Bolivia together. Then he faked his own death. In despair, she almost gave her entire fortune to the mystic so that she could have a few supernatural moments with Keith's ghost.]

:: Major Themes
greed [It turned out that Keith was a conman who was only interested in the heiress Grace for her vast fortune. He had a convoluted plot to convince her that he was not a gold digger, then have his partner scam her out of her fortune by taking advantage of her grief. Grace's ex-husband, her chauffeur, had proven himself to be a gold digger, Grace explained. Divorcing him had cost $100,000.]

ignorance is bliss [The story pointedly culminates with Grace shooting her trusted servant dead, Minnie, for shattering her illusion about the fidelity of her husband's love. Minnie had gone and done some investigation to uncover the elaborate con that Keith had perpetrated. Had she left things well enough alone, Grace would have lost all her money, but lived in blissful ignorance that the love of her life was nothing but a money grubbing conman.]
the inclination to believe what one wants to believe [Grace point blank refused to believe the truth about her beloved Keith even when she was shown evidence by the police that he was a crook. Deranged, she went so far as to shoot her trusted servant dead because she blamed her for shattering her cherished delusions.]
fear of commitment [Grace was afraid of entering into relationships because she had been screwed over by her ex-husband. Therefore she went through pains to masquerade as a poor girl even though she was immensely rich.]

:: Choice Themes
the need to be treated with respect [Central to the story was lowly Charlie using the spellbinding jar he purchased at a carnival to become the talk of the town, and the ongoing center of attention. People now ventured from afar to visit his humble shack, and he would even plan for serving refreshments. It is conveivable that Charlie's obsession with the jar was in part due to him overcompensating for his not being able to control his young and flagrantly unfaithful wife.]

:: Major Themes
yokel stereotype [The viewer is shown some stereotypical country bumpkins in a rural setting.]
husband and wife [Charlie and Thedy Sue Hill. The story explores how Charlie and Thedy's marriage is derailed by Thedy's infidelity coupled with the added stressor of a mysterious new jar that becomes the talk of the town.]
extramarital affair [Thedy Sue was carrying on a barely concealed affair with Tom Carmody.]
love triangle [Thedy Sue carried on shamelessly with Tom Carmody right under her husband's nose.]
spouse murder [The story led up to Charlie being outed for killing his wife and putting her severed head on display in the titular jar.]
young and old romance [There was a marked age difference between Charlie and his younger wife, Thedy Sue, which probably explains why she ran around with a younger man under her husband's nose and why he didn't do anything about it.]
the value of imagination [The townspeople got a lot of joy out of sitting around the jar and pondering what might be contained therein. Their sotto voce musings indicated it dragged up old memories of things that were important to them.]

:: Minor Themes
genie in a lamp [In his closing remarks, Alfred Hitchcock feigned to have encountered an angry genie inside the oversized bottle out of which he'd recently escaped.]
facing a home invader [In his closing remarks, Alfred Hitchcock remarked that the angry genie in question accused Alfred of having broken into its novelty, oversized bottle.]
law enforcement [Instead of chasing down Tom to issue him a speeding ticket, Sheriff Clem plucked himself down in front of the general store, half-heartedly assuring those there that he'd get Tom the next day. Charlie went to the Sheriff Clem to demand that the brazen theft of his much coveted jar be investigated without delay.]
dangerous driving [Instead of chasing down Tom to issue him a speeding ticket, Sheriff Clem plucked himself down in front of the general store, half-heartedly assuring those there that he'd get Tom the next day.]
mental retardation [The town dullard Juke reported that he had the mind of a 10-year-old according to his physician.]
remorse [Juke expressed sorrow over in his youth having drowned.]
jealousy [Charlie insinuated that Tom was jealous of him over his newfound fame.]
mother and daughter [The little girl Eve Ann attended the jar viewing together with her mother.]
monster [The little girl Eve Ann speculated the the bogeyman himself was contained inside the jar.]
childhood terrors [The little girl Eve Ann speculated the the bogeyman himself was contained inside the jar.]
hominid evolution [Jahdoo, after purloining the magic jar and mounting it on a log in his swamp, explained that he knew precisely what it contained. Allegedly it was the precursor to modern day human, and something that had (sic) both evolved out of the bamboo forests and crawled onto land about 10,000 years ago (perhaps we were not meant to take his poetic ramblings literally, but the general meaning was evident).]
theft [Charlie was up in arms after an unknown burglar, later revealed to be Jahdoo commissioned by Tom for a dollar, made off with Charlie's precious jar.]

:: Choice Themes
human vs. captivity [As alluded to in the title, the driving force of the story is John Perry's ardent desire to escape prematurely from his 11 years of incarceration for bank robbery.]

:: Major Themes
what it is like in prison [The story takes place in a maximum security penal labor camp in the US, focused on lumber processing.]
grandfather and granddaughter [Doc was driven by concern for his granddaughter who sorely needed an expensive operation.]
what it is like to be buried alive [The story pointedly concluded with John finding himself buried six feet under in a coffin with no hope of escape.]
compromising one's ethical principles for personal advantage [The plot turned on a point of contention between John and Doc: Should John hasten the surely dying inmate along to the afterlife to ensure his own escape, or wait for nature to take its course? In the event, John did not intervene. The mere fact that he had pondered doing so, however, lead Doc to mistrust him and to drink heavily. This in turn lead to Doc's own death, which foiled John's plans and presumably caused him to die of slow asphyxiation buried alive at the conclusion of the story.]
forced labor camp [The story takes place in and around State Prison Lumber Camp No. 2: a maximum security penal labor camp in the US, focused on lumber processing.]
medical occupation [Doc was an acting physician and long time prisoner at State Prison Lumber Camp No. 2.]

:: Minor Themes
bank robbery [John had been sentenced to ten years in prison for a series of bank robberies netting half a million dollar.]
sadism [If the prison labor camp captain had really been just been concerned about John's "escape record" he would not have canceled John's "good behavior" grace to keep him incarcerated the full 11 years of his sentence. The viewer must conclude that the captain had a particularly nasty desire to inflict suffering on John for no apparent reason other than that he enjoyed doing it.]
coping with a disability [Doc's granddaughter was confined to a wheelchair.]
trust [There was a semi-prolonged issue around whether and to what extent John and Doc could trust one and other. Doc, correctly as it were, assessed that John was the more desperate and therefore would take the leap of faith in handing over the money without any particular assurances that Doc would make good on his end of the bargain without ratting him out to the captain.]
betrayal [Captain leaned on Doc to set John up and betray him. Doc decided to remain true knowing it would cost him dearly in retribution from the vengeful Captain.]
plea bargain dilemma [John was faced with a classical plea-bargain dilemma: Admit guilt and get one year more in prison. Demand your right to an (expensive) trial and the likely outcome would be 5 more years in prison.]
coping with aging [The old man Doc was too old for even light work.]
legal occupation [John's lawyer dropped by the penal labor camp. He gave John a wristwatch, which never figured into the plot.]

spouse murder [As alluded to in the tile, this is a story about murders. Lee and Diana plotted to do away with Diana's rich old husband. Note that while Diana tried to keep herself aloof from the sordid details of the murder, her tacit approval of if makes her an accomplice and the rule of thumb is to use "spouse murder" in this situation.

They must murder him while the marriage is on and then Diana must re-marry Lee, or else Lee would see none of the rich husband's money.]
romantic jealousy [Charles was particularly possessive and jealous of her young and pretty wife, Diana. In the end, he murdered her when he discovered conclusively that she was cheating on him.]
love triangle [Diana and John were running around together behind the back of her husband, Charles, who happened to be producing the stage play in which they were both cast.]

:: Choice Themes
multiple personality disorder [The grand revelation of the story, cleverly concealed in the title, is that the distressed victim and the her malevolent antagonizer are in fact one and the same person. Helen suffers from a peculiar dual personality disorder that makes her take on the persona, and even imitate the voice, of her childhood frenemy Dorothy.]

:: Major Themes
facing a stalker [Helen was coping with her stalker whom she thought was Dorthy.]
mental illness [Before the revelation that Helen is the crazy one, the viewer is led to believe that Dorothy was an unstable character who had more than a few bees in her bonnet. In addition to stalking Helen because of some childhood slight, she broke into a photography studio and made a mess because they wouldn't take her picture.]
legal occupation [Much of the story was told from Helen's lawyer Paul's point of view as he was acting on Helen's behalf.]

the desire for vengeance [The Dorothy persona in Helen wanted revenge for the lie Helen had told to her mother about Dorothy in their childhood.]
jealousy [Helen was deeply envious of Dorothy's grace and beauty, she made clear. This is perhaps meant to be why she started adopting the Dorothy persona in the first place.]

curiosity killed the cat [The central theme alluded to in the title was revealed early and came back in the end with panache: A mysterious door in Bonnie's ancestral home sorely tempted Dave's greedy fingers and he could just barely keep a lid on it not to give his game away. When he finally came into possession of the house in the end, he excitedly opened the door and barged headlong through it plunging to gruesome and prolonged death at the bottom of an abandoned elevator shaft.]

the desire for vengeance [Mrs. Daniels extracted sweet revenge against Dave for marrying her daughter for money and then playing a role in her tragic death.]
suicide [Dave convinced Bonnie to stage a fake suicide. Unbeknownst to him, she knew that the attempt would actually kill her and so it was a real suicide.]

blackmail [The cab driver Mr. Kirby tried to blackmail George for $1000 a month in exchange for keeping quiet about having dropped off George at his mistress' home on the night of her murder.

ironic twist of fate [After Keith killed Elsa and buried her body in the basement, ironically, Elsa herself became the instrument of Keith's undoing since she had recently alerted the authorities to the fact that the previous owner had done the very same thing to his own wife.

unethical human experimentation [In the historical setting featured it was an ethical dilemma whether recently deceased corpses could be experimented upon by medical students.]
alcoholism [Among Aggie's various vices were an acute addiction to the tipple.]
disintegrating romantic relationship [Between McGregor's flashbacks and recounting of happier days and the squalid present in which he was henpecked by a fat alcoholic, we are given a vivid picture of marriage breakdown.]
husband and wife [John and Aggie McGregor.]

:: Minor Themes
remorse [The story ended with John regretting what he had done.]
loneliness [After disposing of his disagreeable wife John, to his surprise, found that he felt lonely.]
poetic justice [John ironically met the very same end he had orchestrated for his wife Aggie. Fate lent a hand in that the doctor happened to let the murderers know about McGregor's drunken rampage.] {FD: whether fate was involved sort of hinges on whether we think the doctor was directly commissioning Burke and Hare and underwriting their homicidal procurement of corpses.}
prostitution [The matchstick girls were quite obviously prostitutes out peddling all that they had to offer.]
getting a taste of one's own medicine [John ironically met the very same end he had orchestrated for his wife Aggie.]
