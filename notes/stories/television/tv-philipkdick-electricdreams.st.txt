enthusiastic about consumerism and is a low-motivation Q.A. worker on a
production line. During the Candidate's speech one night, Philbert hears her
utter the words "kill all others" while those words flash on the screen. Few
others have seen or heard the message but many are affected by it. Only one of

political system. Eventually, Philbert is driven onto an ad where a hanging

that everyone is an "Other".
