Piece of Cake

:: Date
1988

:: Description
Piece of Cake is a 1988 British six-part television serial depicting the life
of a Royal Air Force fighter squadron from the day of the British entry into
World War II through to one of the toughest days in the Battle of Britain (7
September 1940). The series was produced by Holmes Associates for LWT for ITV
and had a budget of five million pounds.

The series is based on the 1983 novel Piece of Cake, by Derek Robinson. In the
book, the squadron is equipped with Hurricanes. The relative rarity of
airworthy Hurricanes in the late 1980s precluded their use in the television
series.

The squadron depicted is the fictional Hornet Squadron, which is equipped with
Supermarine Spitfire fighters, and deployed to France, where it waits out the
Phoney War in comfort and elegance, until the German attack on Western Europe
in May 1940. One by one, nearly all of the original pilots are killed and as
losses mount, the character of the squadron changes from a casual nonchalance
to a fight for survival. By the end of the series, only four of the original
fourteen officers have survived.

Directed by: Ian Toynton. Screenplay by: Leon Griffiths, Derek Robinson.

:: Description
The series begins in September 1939 on the day that war is declared.
Squadron-Leader Ramsey is working furiously to whip Hornet Squadron into
shape. Having just landed after a practice flight, Ramsey accidentally taxis
his Spitfire into a slit-trench and his angry impatience causes him to fall
from the aircraft and fatally fracture his neck. His temporary replacement is
Australian pilot Fanny Barton who is uncertain about his capabilities for such
a role. A tragic mistake is made when Barton leads a patrol to intercept what
they are led to believe is a German attack and he shoots down a bomber, which
is later identified to be a British Blenheim, killing the pilot in the
process. New Squadron Leader Rex arrives and Barton is sent away to face a
court of inquiry. Rex is immediately popular as he provides his pilots with
many luxuries whilst demanding strict discipline and adherence to textbook
tactics in return.

Hornet squadron is dispatched to France to await a possible German invasion.
Billeted in a luxury manor, the pilots live well although one, Moggy
Cattermole, shows himself to be a vicious bully, singling out vulnerable
characters Pip Patterson and Dicky Starr. In a dangerous stunt, Moggy flies
his Spitfire under a low bridge, goading Patterson and Starr to do the same.

remorse. A new pilot arrives, an American named Chris Hart who has fought in

:: Description
The German Blitzkrieg has begun with the invasion of France and Belgium. The
squadron celebrates a double wedding as Fitz and Gordon marry their respective
partners. The happy reception is brutally interrupted by a German air-raid
that causes considerable damage. Rex is badly wounded by shrapnel but conceals
his injuries from the other pilots but the painkillers he takes render him
euphoric and overconfident. Recklessly ordering his men to attack a much
larger German formation, Rex dives down to his death whilst Barton orders the
others not to follow. Now squadron leader, Barton leads what remains of the
squadron against the overwhelming German invaders. Sticky is killed and
Patterson is nearly undone by fear and abandons his still-intact aircraft by
parachute. Gordon's wife Nicole is killed by German air-attack whilst fleeing
as a refugee but Fitz's wife Mary reaches England. The surviving pilots are
likewise evacuated.
