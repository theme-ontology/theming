room, which is very different from Diana's description, but Diana rips off the

The Life Work of Juan Diaz

:: Date
1964-10-26

:: Description
Juan Diaz is dying and penniless. His last wish is that he can provide
financial security for his family. About a year later, a gravedigger named
Alejandro exhumes Juan's corpse to make room in the cemetery. He has it
mummified and stores it in a crypt with a number of other mummies. Juan's
wife, Maria, discovers Alejandro's plan and steals Juan's body. She hangs it
in the house and tells tourists that it is an authentic Mexican mummy. Money
from the tourists pays for food and clothing for Maria and her three children.
Eventually, however, Maria is overcome by the ghoulishness of what she has
done. She begs for forgiveness, but a gleam in the eye of the corpse's body
reveals that Juan approves of what she has done.

Directed by: Norman Lloyd. Story by: Ray Bradbury (story).
