room, which is very different from Diana's description, but Diana rips off the

Fred Riordan is a recent parole who gets into a bar fight and is thrown back
into prison. The prison warden, who is also running for governor, and the
prison doctor believe Fred is simply afraid to cope with the outside world.
They try to find out why. Fred tells them that when he got out of prison he
went to his old neighborhood and realized that no one wanted him around. He
tells them that he was contacted by a mobster named Tony Wando who wanted him
to kill an associate of his. Fred tells them that he pretended to go along
with it, but arranged to go back to prison to get out of the deal. Warden
Bragen feels sorry for Fred and arranges for him to get a comfortable desk job
in the warden's office after a month of laundry detail and good behavior. This
is perfect for Fred because it is Warden Bragen that he was in fact contracted
to hit.
