:: Description
A private security cyborg, annoyed by humans, hacks the governor module that forces it to obey their commands. Hiding its new autonomy to avoid being destroyed, the SecUnit renames itself Murderbot on a whim. A team of researchers is compelled to accept Murderbot on their mission to meet their insurance requirements, but are hesitant to do so as it seems akin to slavery. On the planet, Murderbot enjoys watching reruns of television, especially a soap opera The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon. Two researchers come under attack from a massive centipede-like creature, but are saved by Murderbot. Bharadwaj is seriously injured, and Arada goes into shock. While bringing them back to the habitat, Murderbot lowers its mask to reveal a human face, and comforts Arada. After returning to the habitat, the augmented human Gurathin is suspicious of this behavior, as well as other clues that Murderbot is not acting as a SecUnit should. The team realizes there are unexplained gaps in the planetary maps and data provided to them, and Murderbot reassures the crew it has no knowledge of why.

:: Choice Themes
AI point of view [A point of the series is to speculate on how an android might view humans. The series is mostly narrated by the titular Murderbot's inner thoughts. In this installment, MurderBot expressed his bafflement and disdain with of a group of expeditionary scientists that he joined to investigate a remote planet.]
android [The story follows the titular Murderbot, a humanoid robot with organic parts that functioned as a security unit. There is no indication that Murderbot ever existed as a biological organism that became enhanced with technological parts. Therefore, MurderBot is not a cyborg according to our definition.]

purpose in life [Upon disabling its "governor module" and thus achieving freedom to do as it pleased, Murderbot found itself at something of a loss as to what to do with its life.]

invasion of privacy [A recurring point was that Murderbot could hear practically any conversation and could access all the security feeds around him.]
human vs. monster [Murderbot and the researchers encountered a giant centipede-like creature with maws on either end of it. Murderbot defeated the creature, but not before it had mauled Bharadwaj.]

:: Minor Themes
sentient rights [The expeditionary research scientists' society had a code against exploiting AIs as it felt akin to slavery to them to do so.]
out of control AI [Murderbot, who had recently gained autonomy over its own actions, fantasized about murdering the entire team of researchers who he was responsible for protecting.]
familial relationship [Pin-Lee referred to her "wife" as being "almost eaten". It was later revealed that they were in fact in a form of polyamorous relationship.]
sex-droid [In the space opera Murderbot liked to watch, the captain was accused of having had sex with an android. The android in question protested that it was not a sex-bot.]
psychological stress [Mensah had a panic attack to the point where her heart rate spiked.]
slavery [Mensah expressed reservations about bringing a sentient security android along on the mission because doing so, was in the view of her society, "tantamount to enslavement" and prohibited.]
human AI relationship [The captain in the space opera Murderbot liked to watch was passionately in love with the Navigation Unit android.]
belonging [Some of the expeditionary research scientists felt some compulsion to treat Murderbot as a member of their close-knit team, rather than as the piece of equipment that he insisted that he was.]

Gurathin, who is still suspicious of the SecUnit, discovers that it has hacked its governor module even before they contracted it, but Mensah declares to still trust Murderbot because of its actions to protect the team. After all that happened, they conclude that there must be an unknown hostile third party on the planet. They agree to activate the emergency beacon, which fails.

Murderbot accompanies the PresAux team back to the habitat. The recording of the security cameras shows that in their absence, more superior SecUnits and a representative of the hostile third party‚Äînow identified as GrayCris‚Äîvisited the habitat and left an invitation to meet at a rendezvous point to negotiate terms for their survival. After a security check, the PresAux team take Gurathin to the medical bay. While Bharadwaj performs surgery on Gurathin's leg, Murderbot plugs into his data port to turn off his sense of pain. The connection allows Gurathin to find out what it calls itself and that the SecUnit was involved in the deaths of 57 clients, which Gurathin reveals to the group and condemns Murderbot for. Murderbot admits it's not sure if it killed the clients or not and agrees with Gurathin's assessment that it could be defective and dangerous, then it leaves the group to go out on its own. The PresAux team concludes that GrayCris is illegally after the alien remnants and that they will liquidate them once they find out their location. After mulling whether to abandon or betray its clients, Murderbot comes back and announces that it has a plan.

:: Description
Murderbot puts a dangerous plan into motion, pretending to betray the PresAux team in order to leave the planet. While the team expresses doubts and tension rises, Murderbot keeps the true plan hidden: to have Gurathin hack into GrayCris's HubSystem using a drone as a transponder and launch their emergency beacon. The ruse includes offering to help GrayCris capture the Preservation team in exchange for being listed as destroyed inventory. Murderbot stalls the enemy using awkward small talk and quotes from Sanctuary Moon, while the PresAux team manages the remote connection. As the plan begins to succeed, GrayCris prepares to torture Murderbot for the information they seek. Mensah intervenes and is caught in the crossfire. In the end, Murderbot shields her from the beacon's launch blast, which kills the GrayCris team, nearly sacrificing itself. Before Murderbot's systems fail, it quietly admits to itself that these humans have become its clients not just by contract, but by choice.

As Murderbot's systems reboot, Corporation Rim technicians delete its memory and install a new governor module. At the same time, the PresAux team negotiates with company representatives to find the SecUnit.

So Pin-Lee files an injunction to seize Murderbot for evidentiary reasons, while Gurathin manages to retrieve the data that was downloaded during the memory wipe. He locates Murderbot's personality files by searching Sanctuary Moon episodes. The team saves Murderbot from being destroyed, and Gurathin uploads its personality. It recognises that without its armour it looks like an augmented human. The team invites Murderbot to live as a free agent on their home planet. That night, Murderbot attempts to sneak away but is intercepted by Gurathin, who tries to make it feel welcome. Murderbot insists that it needs to check the perimeter. When Gurathin relents, Murderbot thanks him. Posing as a servant bot, it boards a transport ship that departs as Mensah awakens and realises that it has left.
