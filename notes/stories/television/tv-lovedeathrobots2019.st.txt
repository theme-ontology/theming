Sonnie's Edge

:: Date
2019-03-15

:: Description
In dystopian London, a young woman named Sonnie participates in underground
"Beastie" fights ‚Äî remotely controlled bio-engineered gladiator beast battles.
The ringmaster, Dicko, attempts to bribe Sonnie to throw the match, but she
declines. Her teammates Wes and Ivrina explain that Sonnie was sexually
assaulted and mutilated in the past; her desire for revenge eventually becomes
her "edge". Sonnie enters the arena piloting her beast Khanivore, to fight the
opponent, Turboraptor. After a brutal match, Khanivore wins. Later, Dicko's
mistress visits Sonnie and seduces her, only to impale Sonnie's head with a
concealed weapon. Dicko then reveals himself and taunts Sonnie, asking if she
is scared now. The mistress then stomps at Sonnie's head, crushing it.
However, Sonnie's voice is heard through surrounding speakers, revealing that
her human body is only a 'bioware processor spliced to a spine' and that her
consciousness was always inside Khanivore, the fear of death in combat being
her real "edge". Sonnie as Khanivore breaks out of her holding tank and kills
the mistress, then prepares to kill Dicko. The screen fades to black as she
asks: "Are you scared now?" mirroring Dicko's question.

Three Robots

:: Date
2019-03-15

:: Description
Long after the fall of humanity, three robots (K-VRC, XBOT 4000, and 11-45-G)
wander through a post-apocalyptic city, exploring first-hand how humans lived
based on the things they left behind. They investigate human sports,
nutritional consumption, and eventually pets when they encounter a living cat,
which proceeds to follow them. The three robots learn about their origins and
later arrive at what appears to be a nuclear missile base. 11-45-G explains
that humans died out from environmental disasters caused by their own actions,
while K-VRC states that at one point, humans genetically engineered their
cats, giving them intelligence. The cat then proves this by showing it can
speak, demanding to be petted, while many other cats in the base corner the
three robots.

:: Choice Themes
AI point of view [In a world where humanity had recently gone extinct, a trio of robots toured the ruins of a once thriving metropolis. The robots were very curious about human customs and culture, but invariably got the wrong idea about what everyday life was like for humans (e.g., sports, food intake, and a fascination with cats), owing to their interpreting what they saw from a robot perspective.]
anthropogenic existential risk to civilization [The story takes place in the ruins of a world where humanity had recently gone extinct due to its own actions. For example, the idea was entertained that humanity perished in either a nuclear conflagration or from an self-inflicted ecological catastrophe. The cat explained that humanity genetically engineering cats to have opposable thumbs played a role in humanity extinction. The demise of humanity might have come about from a combination of all three.]

Suits

:: Description
A small community of farmers pilot mech suits to defend their land from an
invading swarm of insectoids which they call "DeeBees". When the defense field
fails, DeeBees pour in faster than they can be repelled, so the community
heads for underground shelters. All arms are called in and one neighbor, Jake,
sacrifices himself to kill a large portion of the swarm. A giant insectoid
breaks through, but one of the farmers' wives destroys it with a well-aimed
shot from a turret gun. Come dawn, the barriers are back to normal and the
town has returned to a sense of safety. The camera zooms out to show that
DeeBees populate the whole planet, and the farmers have set up isolated domed
colonies across the planet.

When the Yogurt Took Over

:: Date

:: Description
A group of scientists mutates yogurt by fermenting bacteria. Although initial
tests fail, a researcher takes the mutated bacteria home for her homemade
yogurt, where it becomes sentient. The yogurt asks to meet US leaders, to whom
it claims to have solutions for the country's problems. As payment, the yogurt
requests control over the state of Ohio. The leaders, including the president,
initially laugh at the offer, but accept it after the yogurt threatens to make
a similar deal with China instead. Soon, the yogurt gives the president a plan
to eradicate the United States national debt, warning him that any deviation
will be catastrophic. The government cannot help but deviate, and the global
economy collapses within 6 months except for Ohio. In desperation, the
government gives the yogurt supreme executive power over much opposition. A
decade later, humans live prosperous lives under the yogurt's reign. The
yogurt suddenly decides to initiate space launches, leaving the humans behind
on Earth.

Beyond the Aquila Rift

:: Date

:: Description
The Blue Goose spaceship's crew members, Thom, Suzy, and Ray, are returning
home from a successful mission, but an error in the hyperspace routing causes
unexpected events to happen. Thom awakes from suspended animation and is
greeted by Greta, an old flame. She tells him that he and his crew are
hundreds of thousands of light-years from Earth, nearly beyond the Aquila
Rift, and centuries have passed: there is no way for them to get home. They
have sex and rekindle their relationship, but Thom is still in disbelief of
the situation, especially after Suzy wakes up and hysterically claims that
Greta is not real. He demands the truth from a tearful Greta, who tells him
that his experiences are a simulation and that he is not ready to see reality,
as she truly does care for him and all those who find their way there. He
insists, so she reluctantly relents and awakens him. Thom is revealed to be an
emaciated old man; their ship caught in an enormous web with countless others;
his crew either dead or trapped in their own trances; and "Greta" an alien
arachnid creature. As horrified Thom loses his mind from the encounter,
"Greta" returns him to the dream world, minus his recent memories, just as she
had with his crew and the others. She reawakens him and greets him all over
again.

magic and now works as a courtesan. Yan informs him that she was drugged by
the governor of Hong Kong, a client of hers, who surgically switched her real
legs with cyborg parts before she killed him during an altercation. As Liang

Astronaut Alexandria Stephens attends to a faulty satellite in Earth's orbit.
During a spacewalk, her old-model EVA suit is hit by a stray screw from

the left glove, exposing her left arm to the vacuum of space. Throwing the
glove pushes her back toward the satellite, but she narrowly misses grabbing
hold. As she drifts back past her beaten-up maintenance vehicle The Anthem,
she decides to break off her now frozen left forearm and throws it in the
last-ditch attempt to make it back to her ship. Back on board, she performs
emergency self triage then radios Bill, her ground controller, who asks with

:: Description
Journalist Claire Markham is invited to interview the reclusive artist Zima
Blue, who wishes to tell his story before unveiling his final work. Zima, who
began in portraiture, moved on to murals focused on abstract shapes in a
single shade of blue. He continued making larger murals until they were
incorporated into celestial bodies, asteroids, and even nebulas. When they
meet, Zima reveals to Claire that even though many assume he is a
cybernetically enhanced man, in truth he is an advanced android originally
built by a roboticist to clean ceramic pool tiles (known as Zima Blue tiles),
with the tiles being the first thing he saw. He was upgraded and modified as a
test-bed for hardware and software to his current state, passed from owner to
owner after his original owner died. Expressing a deep yearning for meaning
through his art, he unveils his final piece: he immerses himself in the re-
constructed pool that he originated from, casts off all of his modifications,
and reverts to his original state as a simple pool tile cleaning machine.

2022-05-20

:: Description
The three robots (K-VRC, XBOT 4000, and 11-45-G) embark on yet another post-
apocalyptic trip. They investigate sites where remnants of humanity from
different societal classes tried unsuccessfully to survive the apocalypse. At
a primitive survivalist camp for the poor, food scarcity caused by overhunting
triggered lethal conflicts. An oil rig refurbished into a luxury resort for
the rich failed when the inhabitants relied too much on AI, which rebelled and
began the robot uprising. Government officials in a self-sustaining bunker
resorted to cannibalism after a fungus ravaged their hydroponic crops. The
final site the robots visit is a high-tech rocket launch base, built
exclusively by and for the Earth's richest, with the far-fetched intention to
quickly leave the dying planet and colonize Mars. Their plans failed; it is
revealed that humanity had more than enough resources to save both the
environment and themselves, but perished because of their greed. The robots
discover that one shuttle did leave with some of Earth's inhabitants
inside‚Äîunbeknownst to them, it was the intelligent cats instead of the humans.

:: Choice Themes
AI point of view [In a world where humanity had recently gone extinct, a trio of robots toured sites where remnants of humanity from different societal classes tried unsuccessfully to survive the apocalypse. They interpreted an misinterpreted the ruins through their robot perspectives.]
anthropogenic existential risk to civilization [The story takes place in the ruins of a world where humanity had recently gone extinct. For example, the idea was entertained that humanity perished in either a nuclear conflagration or from an self-inflicted ecological catastrophe or from rebellious robots. The cat explained that humanity genetically engineering cats to have opposable thumbs played a role in humanity extinction. The demise of humanity might have come about from a combination of all three.]

:: Major Themes
humanoid robot [The story follows three robot friends, two of whom were humanoid in form, as they toured sites where remnants of humanity from different societal classes had tried unsuccessfully to survive the apocalypse.]
social inequality [The story explores how people from different social classes prepared to save their hides from a coming apocalypse. The survivalists hunkered down in the wilderness. The Libertarians converted an oil rig into a self-sustaining floating city. The political elites elected to wait out the worst of it in an underground bunker. The tech elites planned to reboot civilization on Mars. All perished.]
ecological destruction [Among the various reasons humans had died out, it was made clear, the destruction of the environment was a big contributing factor.]
rise of the machines [One interpretation of the story is that a robot uprising that started on the converted oil rig spread around the world, and culminated in the three robots exploring the archaeological remains of human civilization.]

:: Minor Themes
survivalism [The three robot friends visited the ruins of a survivalist encampment. The robots saw irony in the fact that the survivalists were ill-prepared for the very post-apocalyptic world they had been waiting for with bated breath.]
the need for freedom [11-45-G commented that the survivalists thought "with freedom from government" they could found a utopian society.]
slaves to technology [It was revealed that the oil rig Libertarians had grown overly reliant on their machine servants, and were ultimately overthrown by them.]
cannibalism [In the underground bunker, the robots stumbled on the ghastly scene of the Secretary of Agriculture having been served as dinner together with '79 Merlot.]
colonization of Mars [The robots visited the ruins of a rocket launching site that tech elites had planned to use as a gateway to Mars. There on the Red Planet they had hoped to reboot civilization. The story concluded with the revelation that a species of talking cat had colonized Mars instead.]

Bad Travelling

:: Date
2022-05-20

:: Description
A giant man-eating crustacean called a "thanapod" violently boards a shark-
hunting ship, slaughtering most of its crew before occupying the ship's hold.
After drawing straws, the ship's first mate and navigator, Torrin, is unfairly
chosen by a bigger crewmate (who drew a shorter straw than Torrin) to confront
the thanapod. Puppeteering the body of a slain crewman, it demands to be taken
to the nearby Phaiden Island, where it will presumably feed on the
unsuspecting population. Torrin accepts on the condition that his life be
spared. Throwing the prior cheating crewmate to the thanapod, and holding the
crew at gunpoint, he asks them to vote on whether to agree to the thanapod's
demands or to trick it by dropping it off on a farther deserted island, a
longer trip that makes survival less likely but spares Phaiden Island's
population. Torrin then executes two of the crew who voted to go to Phaiden
Island and feeds their bodies to the thanapod to buy time. However, the
thanapod demands more food to feed its newly hatched offspring. When the crew
mutinies, Torrin kills them and feeds them to the thanapods. Torrin reveals to
the last crew member that every crew member voted for the shorter voyage
before pushing him to his death. Nearing Phaiden Island, Torrin then sets the
shark oil in the ship's hold on fire and escapes in a lifeboat, killing the
thanapod and its brood.

sacrifice to prevent mass death [Torrin could have taken the easy route by giving into the giant man-eating crab monster's demand to be transported to a nearby populated island, where the crab monster and its brood would presumably feast on the local inhabitants. Instead, Torrin executed a plan, at great personal risk to himself, that culminated with the crab monster and its brood being fricasseed in shark oil.]

Astronaut Martha Kivelson is left alone on the surface of Io after an SEV
accident causes the death of her partner, Burton. With her own oxygen
exhausted and support from her space station hours away, Kivelson uses
Burton's supply and drags her body across the moon back to their landing
craft. After taking morphine to numb the pain of a broken arm, Kivelson begins
to experience hallucinations. She hears Io itself speaking to her through
Burton, provoking her interaction. Desperate to reach her destination in time,
she takes amphetamine, worsening her hallucinations. She eventually comes to
view the moon as a machine whose purpose is "to know [her]", before falling
unconscious. Waking up with critical oxygen levels, Kivelson jumps into a
river of thermal liquid and seemingly assimilates into the moon, suggesting
her hallucinations are in fact real. Her voice is later heard reporting back
to Earth's station.

causing a zombie apocalypse. Hordes of zombies quickly overrun population
centers across the planet, wiping out most of humanity. As the world devolves
into anarchy, the remaining humans try to fight back but instead give rise to
giant mutant zombies when a nuclear power station is destroyed. Unable to stop
them, the President of the United States eventually launches every nuclear
missile in the American arsenal, which triggers other nations to launch their

Simon Afriel arrives as part of a two-year research mission to an alien planet
inhabited by a race referred to only as the Swarm. Joining with another human
researcher, Galina Mirny, the two explore the Swarm hive, which is composed of
multiple castes of alien species that had been absorbed into the hive, each
playing a specific role in maintaining the ecosystem. Simon reveals to Galina
that his goal is to obtain and exploit the Swarm's genetic information,
pairing it with artificial pheromones to create a new, more subservient swarm
that will help humanity expand. Despite initial disapproval, Galina chooses to
assist him as long as the nest remains unharmed. As time passes, the two
become increasingly intimate. Their experiments, however, trigger a hostile
response from the hive, which forcibly assimilates Galina. The Swarm speaks to
Simon, explaining how the hive had absorbed intelligent species deemed as
threats in the past and reduced them to symbiotic species. It tells Simon he
can assist doing so with humans and retain his intelligence or be forcibly
assimilated himself. He accepts the offer as a challenge, insisting that the
human race will never become parasites.

Mason's Rats

:: Date

:: Description
In a future version of Scotland, a farmer named Mason is distressed to
discover the rats in his barn are bigger than before, standing upright on two
legs, using tools and attacking him with crossbows as they pilfer his
genetically modified supplies. Enlisting the services of the high-tech
Traptech pest control company, Mason installs five TT-6 pulse lasers into his
barn. The lasers are effective until the leader of the rats discovers their
positions and disables each laser. At his wits' end, Mason is talked into
buying the TT-15, a scorpion-like mobile assault robot by Traptech. For the
next several days, the TT-15 does its job gruesomely well; much to Mason's
growing discomfort, especially at all the damage the robot leaves in its wake
to his property. After one of its laser shots destroys his mug, narrowly
missing his head, a furious Mason storms into the barn; only to see the
interior destroyed and the rats mounting a heroic final stand against the
mech. They manage to severely damage it using one of his tractors outfitted
with the missing pulse laser as a tank. Mason, impressed by the rats' courage
and upset with the TT-15 now destroying his property, finishes the mech off
with a shotgun blast to the CPU. He makes peace with the rats; the group
raises a glass of brandy, distilled from Mason's grain, and watches the sunset
together as he cancels a check for Traptech.

who initiated contact, desiring to converse with him after he witnesses the
supposed resurrection of a dolphin known as Blackfin that the Lupo believes is
the Messiah. Pressured by superiors, the military, and public opinion, Donal

:: Choice Themes
social inequality [A point of the story was to compare and contrast the decadent aristocratic spectators with the gladiators they controlled and used for their own entertainment. One gathers that the gladiators had been taken from subjugated peoples. Mei came from the moon Europa and had had nearly all her memories taken from her. Some remnants remained, which caused her to turn on her oppressors in the end.]
blood sports [The story follows Mei as she competes in a ritual death race between between gladiators and a stampede of Triceratops.]

:: Major Themes
human vs. beast [Mei and the other gladiators took part in a ritual death race that featured a stampede of Triceratops.

institutionalized human blood sports society [The story is set in a distant future where ritual combat between human gladiators and dinosaurs is an integral part of society's royal weddings.]
marriage ceremony [The setting of the story is a royal wedding between nobles from different Jupiter moons in a space arena.]

the desire for vengeance [Mei somehow controlled the T-Rex and turned it on the royal couple in an act of vengeance that had a twofold origin: Her lover had just been killed before her eyes due to the unfair turn in the competition to suddenly unleash a T-Rex. Also remnants of her memories informed her to some extent of the enslaved condition of herself and the people from which came.]
coping with opposing a friend [Mei had to fight a deadly fight with her own lover and only narrowly managed to spare the woman's life.]

During World War II, a bomber crew is tasked with dropping bombs from a B-17
on a church in France. The mission is led by a mysterious man. As they
approach the target, a Nazi officer performs a ritual, sacrificing several
priests to summon an unknown creature. Despite successfully destroying the
church, the creature survives and attacks the bomber midair. It kills most of
the crew but is ultimately stopped when Zeke fires a shot that strikes it with
the golden cross of another crew member. The force of the impact presses the
cross into the creature, killing it. One of the few survivors, Zeke‚Äîwho had
