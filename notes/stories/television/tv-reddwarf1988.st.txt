The End

:: Date
1988-02-15

:: Description
Aboard the Jupiter Mining Corporation (JMC) vessel Red Dwarf, the lowest-
ranking crew member, slobbish technician Dave Lister (Craig Charles) is
sentenced to be frozen for 18-months in suspended animation as punishment for
breaking quarantine regulations by smuggling his pregnant cat Frankenstein on
board, a pet he had obtained while on leave on Titan. When given the option of
either having the cat dissected or be frozen in stasis, he chooses to save his
cat. However, Lister awakes from stasis only to find the rest of the crew have
since been wiped out in a radiation disaster, and he has actually been frozen
for three million years. However, to both his relief and horror, he is not
alone. The ship's computer Holly (Norman Lovett) has revived Arnold Rimmer
(Chris Barrie), his austere and petty bunkmate, in the form of a hologram, who
was responsible for the accident that wiped out the crew. Also Lister's
pregnant cat, Frankenstein, was sealed in the hull during the radiation leak,
and her kittens bred there for 3-million years and evolved into a race of
humanoid life-forms, Felis sapiens, bred from the domestic housecat and about
half as smart. They meet one of these life forms on the ship, and Lister
decides to call it Cat (Danny John-Jules).

Chasing the vapour trail of Red Dwarf into a gas nebula, Starbug is taken over

Legion, a highly intelligent, sophisticated and cultured lifeform conceived
out of an experiment by a group of famous scientists. It is Legion who
modifies Rimmer's holo-projection unit, enabling him to become a "hardlight"
hologram (his jacket goes from red in "softlight" to blue in hardlight), as a
result he is able to touch, feel, eat, and experience pain – but still being
made of light, cannot be physically harmed. They learn that Legion is composed
from the minds of each member of the crew, combined and magnified, and as such
they are sustaining his very existence with their presence. Legion will not
allow them to leave and continue the search for Red Dwarf.

travels from his own dimension into the dimension where Starbug is cruising.
His intention is to try and bring out courage in the cowardly version of
himself aboard Starbug, and then recruit Arnold Rimmer as his replacement, so
that after his death another Rimmer will carry on the legacy of the
interstellar space hero.

The nanobots have rebuilt Red Dwarf to its original design plans. In effect,
the fresh new Red Dwarf is better than the old version of the ship the
nanobots deconstructed in the first place – faster, more streamlined,
containing more advanced technology, which was not included the first time
round due to budget cutbacks. After crashing Starbug in the docking bay, they
discover the nanobots have also resurrected the original crew complement of
Red Dwarf who were killed in the radioactive disaster three million years
previously, and who now have no memory of the incident or events following it.
Lister tries to persuade the newly resurrected Arnold Rimmer to help him
escape so that he can track down the nanobots to corroborate his story, but
the only way for Lister to convince Rimmer is by helping Rimmer get promoted
using a disc of confidential files left in the crashed wreckage of Starbug.
