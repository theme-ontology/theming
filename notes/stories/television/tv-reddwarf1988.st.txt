The End

:: Date
1988-02-15

:: Description
Aboard the Jupiter Mining Corporation (JMC) vessel Red Dwarf, the lowest-
ranking crew member, slobbish technician Dave Lister (Craig Charles) is
sentenced to be frozen for 18-months in suspended animation as punishment for
breaking quarantine regulations by smuggling his pregnant cat Frankenstein on
board, a pet he had obtained while on leave on Titan. When given the option of
either having the cat dissected or be frozen in stasis, he chooses to save his
cat. However, Lister awakes from stasis only to find the rest of the crew have
since been wiped out in a radiation disaster, and he has actually been frozen
for three million years. However, to both his relief and horror, he is not
alone. The ship's computer Holly (Norman Lovett) has revived Arnold Rimmer
(Chris Barrie), his austere and petty bunkmate, in the form of a hologram, who
was responsible for the accident that wiped out the crew. Also Lister's
pregnant cat, Frankenstein, was sealed in the hull during the radiation leak,
and her kittens bred there for 3-million years and evolved into a race of
humanoid life-forms, Felis sapiens, bred from the domestic housecat and about
half as smart. They meet one of these life forms on the ship, and Lister
decides to call it Cat (Danny John-Jules).

Legion, a highly intelligent, sophisticated and cultured lifeform conceived
out of an experiment by a group of famous scientists. It is Legion who
modifies Rimmer's holo-projection unit, enabling him to become a "hardlight"
hologram (his jacket goes from red in "softlight" to blue in hardlight), as a
result he is able to touch, feel, eat, and experience pain – but still being
made of light, cannot be physically harmed. They learn that Legion is composed
from the minds of each member of the crew, combined and magnified, and as such
they are sustaining his very existence with their presence. Legion will not
allow them to leave and continue the search for Red Dwarf.
