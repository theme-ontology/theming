At the Twins, Arya fatally poisons the remaining lords of House Frey. The
White Walkers march toward the Wall, where Tollett allows Bran and Meera
inside. At Winterfell, despite Sansa's disapproval, Jon secures the loyalties
of Houses Umber and Karstark, who fought alongside Ramsay in the Battle of the
Bastards. At the Citadel, Samwell steals books that reveal a large reservoir
of dragonglass in Dragonstone, and sends word to Jon. He later finds Jorah in
a cell. In the Riverlands, Arya meets a group of friendly Lannister soldiers,
who take her intention to kill Cersei as a joke. Thoros shows Sandor a vision
in the fire. The revelation leads him to believe in the Lord of Light. In
King's Landing, Jaime tells Cersei of the crucial need for allies. She
welcomes Euron, who proposes marriage to her in exchange for his Iron Fleet
and a chance to kill Theon and Yara. Cersei declines citing trust as a
concern, so Euron promises to return with a "gift" to prove his loyalty.

Stannis, with her army and dragons.

capture a wight to bring South as evidence of the White Walkers' existence.
After successfully capturing one, the group is besieged by the White Walker
army. Jon has Gendry return to Eastwatch and send a raven to Daenerys to
request her help. Thoros freezes to death overnight. Daenerys arrives and

Jon's neutrality in the Great War, but he upholds his oath to Daenerys,

Westeros. Disgusted, Jaime deserts her and rides north. Bound for White
Harbor, Jon and Daenerys make love. At Dragonstone, Theon earns the respect of

North, Sansa has Arya execute him. Samwell arrives at Winterfell and meets
