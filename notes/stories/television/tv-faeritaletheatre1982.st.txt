:: Choice Themes
appearances can be deceiving [The moral of the story was more or less spelled out by the narrator in the beginning. It is that there can be more to people (and nightingales) than first meets the eye. The kitchen maid was disdained by the aristocrats, and the nightingale put aside for a clockwork bird; yet they both ended up saving the emperor.] {MO: we might add "there can be more to people than meets the eye" or something as a child theme. PS: I think it wise to set a high bar for choice themes for these classical tales - with the understanding that any given rendition may emphasize things in unique ways.}

:: Major Themes
absolute monarchy [The story concerned the Emperor of Cathay and his activities in governing the empire.]
master and servant [The story concerned the aristocrats in the imperial palace, and their interactions with various servants.]

music [The story concerned a nightingale who made beautiful music.]
human vs. technology [The nightingale had a human-like personality and was offended at being pitted against a mechanical bird. The Emperor soon came to regret his foolish decision.]
friendship [In her introduction, Shelley Duvall summed up the story as being about "an emperor who finds true friendship (with a little song bird)".]
loyalty [] {For discussion: Nightingale to Emperor in the end. }

:: Minor Themes
gluttony [The Emperor indulged in the most ridiculously elaborate and exotic dishes.]
gastronomy [The Emperor indulged in the most ridiculously elaborate and exotic dishes.]
coping with a loved one being gravely ill [The kitchen maid sought a cure for her ailing mother. Later she did the same for her beloved Emperor.]
mother and daughter [] {MO: not featured in the end I think}
death incarnate [The ailing emperor was visited by (or perhaps hallucinated) what was apparently meant to be an oriental version of the Grim Reaper.]
fairies [Two fairies revealed to the kitchen maid the location of a curative ginseng root in exchange for being complimented on how pretty they were.]
