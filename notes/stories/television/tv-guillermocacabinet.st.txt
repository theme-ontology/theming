:: Description
In 1991, military veteran Nick (Tim Blake Nelson), chased by debt collectors
buys abandoned storage units. He buys one for $400 after the original owner
passed away. Nick had earlier bought house cleaner Emilia's (Elpidia Carrillo)
unit after her failure to pay her bill due to a miscommunication with the
manager, Eddie (Demetrius Grosse). She pleads with Nick to get to get back her
things, but he refuses and gives her the unit's original padlock. While
searching the unit, Nick mentions to manager Eddie that the unit seems smaller
compared to the others. Eddie tells him that the building was built in the
1940s and nothing was up to code.  Nick continues to dig through the things in
the unit while Emilia lingers outside. He finds a beautiful table set with
arcane markings and takes them to an occult shop for an appraisal. The shop
owner is entranced with the items saying they are a very old Séance set. She
touches the table triggering a hidden mechanism so a drawer pops open with
three occult books inside. The shop keep calls in calls Roland (Sebastian
Roché), an expert who can give Nick a proper appraisal on the books. Roland
immediately identifies the books and asks where the fourth one is. He tells
Nick that the books are a set that are designed to summon and make a pact with
a demon and that the fourth book burns up at the end of the transaction, thus
making it a very rare item. Nick says if there is one more book to be found,
it'll be back in the unit. Roland offers Nick money for the table on the spot
with a promise of a $300,000 payday if they find the final book. On the drive
to the building, Roland tells Nick that the owner of the unit was a weapon
maker from the World War II era and did horrible things for the Nazis.  At the
unit, they find a false wall in back. Prying it open, they discover a brick
hallway lined with crucifixes and a horrible smell. Roland tells Nick not to
do or say anything while they are in there in case it will trigger a demon.
After a walk inside, they find the nearly mummified body of the unit owner's
sister laying on the ground in a binding circle with demon tentacles where her
face should be. Nick, unimpressed, goes for the fourth book on a stand across
the room. Roland warns him not to proceed but Nick, unheeding, stumbles
through the circle disrupting it. The demon resurrects, destroying most of the
host body that was keeping it trapped, and the book bursts into flames. Roland
is consumed by the demon and Nick runs away while the demon, now a mass of
writhing tentacles, stalks him through the hallways. Nick runs to the only
exit out of the storage building but finds the door is locked from the
outside. He sees Emilia and pleads for her to open the door. Emilia gestures
that she'll help but then Nick watches in horror as she holds up the padlock
he gave her and locks the door. As he turns around to run, he's consumed by
the demon.

facing financial ruin [Nick was down on his luck, in debt, and a hair away from total financial ruin.]
racism in society [There was pointed racism in the dialogue. In particular, Nick made slurs against Latino's and told Emilia that she should at least make an effort to insult him in English if she had to come to his country. This was perhaps the sin for which he died in the end.]
the role of war veterans in society [Nick and Eddie were both veterans form the Vietnam war. We saw how their fortunes were and heard that, at least in Nick's case, he derived them from what had happened to him during the war.]

Graveyard Rats

:: Date
2022-10-25

:: Description
In Salem, Massachusetts, graveyard caretaker Masson (David Hewlett) catches
two grave robbers stealing valuables from a corpse. At gunpoint he forces them
to hand over the stolen items while telling them that graveyards mark the
start of human civilization and will signal its end when people stop
respecting the dead. After the robbers leave, Masson continues to steal from
the corpse by pulling out a gold tooth. He drops the tooth and, while
searching for it in the coffin, is bitten by a rat.  Masson takes the loot to
Hans (Nabeel El Khafif) who says that lately Masson has been coming up short.
Masson tells him that rats have been stealing valuables from the dead
throughout the entire cemetery. Hans gives Masson one week to pay back his
debt. Masson goes to see city morgue employee Dooley (Julian Richings) for
tips on wealthy deceased slated for burial so as to steal their gold fillings.
Dooley is bribed with drugs and brings Masson into the embalming room, where
the last body is a wealthy merchant with a mouth full of gold teeth. Masson
goes insane trying to get them and Dooley convinces him to come back the next
day to keep the coroner from asking questions and giving away the scheme. The
deceased man's family arrives and Masson and Dooley spy as the widow
designates that he should be buried with medals and his expensive sword from
King George V.  After the funeral, Masson digs up the grave to witness rats
taking the body. Fearing what Hans' punishment for failing to pay, Masson,
despite suffering from claustrophobia, crawls in after the body. He is chased
by a pack of rats that attack and bite him and scares them off firing his gun.
Hearing a growl in the tunnel, a giant hairless rat corners him. Masson shoots
the giant rat but it claws and chases him through the tunnels until he falls
into a hole ending up on a pile of human bones.  Masson is thrilled when he
finds valuable jewelry and the sword. He realizes that he is inside a stone
structure in front of an altar to a demonic entity, a place Masson calls "The
Black Church." He sees a dessicated body with a beautiful gold pendant which
he tries to take. The body animates and attacks a screaming Masson and repeats
"Mine!". Masson escapes, with the zombie following him into a tunnel where the
giant rat is waiting. They fight and Masson is victorious. Masson sees a light
and crawls towards it, but it turns out to be a reflection from his lamp
against a plate on a coffin. The rats attack Masson. Later, the grave robbers
dig up the coffin and find Masson's body with the jewels, but rats crawl out
of his mouth when they try to take the loot.

The Autopsy

:: Date
2022-10-26

:: Description
Dr. Carl Winters (F. Murray Abraham), an elderly forensic pathologist
suffering from terminal stomach cancer, travels to a small town to perform
autopsies on a group of 10 men killed by an explosion in a local coal mine.
Winters' friend, local sheriff Nate Craven (Glynn Turman), recounts for him
the events leading up to the explosion: After a string of missing-persons
cases, Craven and his deputies settle on a suspect named Elliott Sykes (Luke
Roberts), a man who had himself gone missing from a neighboring town, only to
turn up working for the local coal mine under the assumed name Joe Allen.
Craven searches Sykes' hotel room, finding a strange orb-like object, which he
confiscates. Later, at the coal mine, Sykes steals back the object and flees
into the mine, triggering an explosion that kills Sykes and 9 other miners.
Setting up a makeshift morgue in an abandoned slaughterhouse, Winters begins
performing the autopsies, documenting his findings on a tape recorder. As the
autopsies continue, Winters begins noticing that the bodies are all completely
drained of their blood. Soon, the corpse of Sykes reanimates and reveals to
Winters that he is the host for a parasitic alien. The alien, who feeds on
human blood, but is near-starvation due to Sykes' death, seeks to transfer
into Winters' body to continue living. Winters resists, but the alien
incapacitates him and restrains him on the operating table. Winters regains
consciousness as Sykes begins to perform an autopsy on himself, in order to
maintain the appearance that Winters had completed his job, and to give the
alien easy exit from the corpse. As the alien leaves Sykes' body and rigor
mortis sets in, Winters is able to obtain the scalpel, which he uses to
sabotage his senses of sight and hearing, as well as slitting his major
arteries. With the blood, Winters writes a message on his chest. As the alien
takes control of his body, Winters informs it that the body is near-death,
effectively trapping the alien with no food source. He also reveals that his
tape recorder was left on, and has recorded much of his interactions with the
alien. Winters collapses on the floor as his heartbeat slows to a stop. Craven
arrives to find Winters' body, with the words: "PLAY THE TAPE. BURN ME."

The Outside

:: Description
Awkward and unattractive bank teller Stacey Chapman (Kate Micucci) is invited
to a Christmas party by her co-worker, Gina. At the party, Stacey feels
excluded by her vain and gossiping colleagues, and is further humiliated when
her secret Santa gift of a taxidermied duck is received unenthusiastically.
Gina gifts each party-goer a box of Alo Glo, an expensive and popular skin
lotion. Upon applying the lotion, Stacey finds that it severely irritates her
skin. Stacey's husband Keith (Martin Starr) tries to boost her self-esteem,
but is unsuccessful. Discouraged and unable to sleep, Stacey stays up watching
television, only to happen across a commercial for Alo Glo. Stacey soon
realizes that the ad's spokesman (Dan Stevens) is talking directly to her,
promising her that Alo Glo will make her beautiful if she continues to use it,
going so far to say that it will make her a "new you." Stacey secretly orders
a case of the lotion, and continues to use it, despite the irritation. Stacey
soon finds that the tubes of Alo Glo have begun bursting, creating a puddle of
lotion in her basement. A humanoid figure emerges from the puddle, mirroring
Stacey's movements. Sensing familiarity with the figure, Stacey kisses and
embraces it. Keith finally attempts to confront Stacey, but she stabs him in
the forehead before killing him with an axe. Stacey then finds the lotion-
figure in the bathroom, where it disintegrates back into lotion in her
bathtub. Stacey submerges herself in the lotion, and re-emerges beautiful.
Stacey taxidermies Keith's body, disposing of his organs in the garbage. The
next day, Stacey's co-workers are struck by her newfound beauty. Stacey laughs
and gossips with them, but soon is overtaken with a sense of unease.

the desire to be beautiful [The plot centers on Stacey's drive to be glamorously beautiful, like she believes her female coworkers are.]

:: Major Themes
what if I was really beautiful [The story concluded with Stacey finding out what it might be like to actually be really beautiful.]
jealousy [Stacey was envious of her (to her eyes) glamorous and attractive female coworkers.]
husband and wife [Stacey had a loving husband whom she ended up killing and taxidermising.]
spouse murder [Stacey ended up putting a knife in her husbands prefrontal cortex, lodges an axe in his back, and then taxidermising his body, all because he didn't approve of her recklessly dowsing herself in a peculiar cream to which she seamed to be allergic but which she was convinced made her beautiful.]
descent into madness [At her coworker's Christmas party, Stacey was gifted a beauty cream that seemed to prompt an allergic reaction. In fact, through a peculiar combination of effects, it hooked Stacey on applying evermore of it and then made her become more and more unhinged. She ended up killing and taxidermising her husband.]
magic potion [One interpretation of the story is that Stacy was completely sane and did not hallucinate. Evidence: The beautification process did things, like straightening her teeth, that could not have been a psychological effect. In this case we would have to conclude that there was something entirely supernatural about the lotion she was using, much like a magic potion of yore.]

:: Minor Themes
true beauty comes from within [] {FD: did Stacey magically become beautiful from a truly magical cream, or must we at least ponder the possibility that the madness of the cream and the allergic reaction simply brought at a self-confidence in her and that it was all that it took for her to appear beautiful?}
female-female rivalry [] {FD}

The Viewing

:: Description
In 1979, novelist Guy Landon (Steve Agee), astrophysicist Charlotte Xie
(Charlyne Yi), musician Randall Roth (Eric André), and psychic Targ Reinhard
(Michael Therriault) receive invitations from enigmatic billionaire Lionel
Lassiter (Peter Weller), for a viewing at his mansion, The Sandpiper House.
The group is escorted to the house by Lassiter's assistant, Hector, and are
received by Lassiter's personal physician, Doctor Zahra (Sofia Boutella).
Lassiter soon joins them, sharing a unique bottle of whiskey. As the group
drinks and takes drugs, prepared for them by Zahra, Lassiter expresses his
admiration for each guest's talents and accomplishments. When asked for
information regarding himself or his past, Lassiter remains vague, instead
choosing to point out the uniqueness and singularity of his possessions,
including his house, his music, and Zahra herself. Lassiter soon takes them to
a room he dubs "The Obelisk Chamber", in which Lassiter displays a strange,
rock-like object. Charlotte remarks on its similarities to meteorites, though
the object appears to have none of the damage that meteorites would have. Targ
claims to sense a psychic energy within the object, while Landon is
unimpressed. Lassiter claims that the object is impervious to X-Rays and
carbon dating. Despite Lassiter's wishes, Randall repeatedly smokes near the
object. The object appears to absorb the smoke, and soon crumbles away,
revealing a horned, slime-like creature within. The creature kills Targ, Guy,
and Zahra before absorbing Lassiter's body and electrocuting Hector after he
shoots it with an AK-47. Randall and Charlotte successfully escape the
mansion, and confirm to each other that the events they witnessed were, in
fact, real. The creature wanders from the mansion and into a culvert, later
emerging from a storm drain in a crowded, urban area.
