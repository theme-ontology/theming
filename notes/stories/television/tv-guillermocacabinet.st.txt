:: Description
In 1991, military veteran Nick, chased by debt collectors buys abandoned
storage units. He buys one for $400 after the original owner passed away. Nick
had earlier bought house cleaner Emilia's unit after her failure to pay her
bill due to a miscommunication with the manager, Eddie. She pleads with Nick
to get to get back her things, but he refuses and gives her the unit's
original padlock. While searching the unit, Nick mentions to manager Eddie
that the unit seems smaller compared to the others. Eddie tells him that the
building was built in the 1940s and nothing was up to code. Nick continues to
dig through the things in the unit while Emilia lingers outside. He finds a
beautiful table set with arcane markings and takes them to an occult shop for
an appraisal. The shop owner is entranced with the items saying they are a
very old Séance set. She touches the table triggering a hidden mechanism so a
drawer pops open with three occult books inside. The shop keep calls in calls
Roland, an expert who can give Nick a proper appraisal on the books. Roland
immediately identifies the books and asks where the fourth one is. He tells
Nick that the books are a set that are designed to summon and make a pact with
a demon and that the fourth book burns up at the end of the transaction, thus
making it a very rare item. Nick says if there is one more book to be found,
it'll be back in the unit. Roland offers Nick money for the table on the spot
with a promise of a $300,000 payday if they find the final book. On the drive
to the building, Roland tells Nick that the owner of the unit was a weapon
maker from the World War II era and did horrible things for the Nazis. At the
unit, they find a false wall in back. Prying it open, they discover a brick
hallway lined with crucifixes and a horrible smell. Roland tells Nick not to
do or say anything while they are in there in case it will trigger a demon.
After a walk inside, they find the nearly mummified body of the unit owner's
sister laying on the ground in a binding circle with demon tentacles where her
face should be. Nick, unimpressed, goes for the fourth book on a stand across
the room. Roland warns him not to proceed but Nick, unheeding, stumbles
through the circle disrupting it. The demon resurrects, destroying most of the
host body that was keeping it trapped, and the book bursts into flames. Roland
is consumed by the demon and Nick runs away while the demon, now a mass of
writhing tentacles, stalks him through the hallways. Nick runs to the only
exit out of the storage building but finds the door is locked from the
outside. He sees Emilia and pleads for her to open the door. Emilia gestures
that she'll help but then Nick watches in horror as she holds up the padlock
he gave her and locks the door. As he turns around to run, he's consumed by
the demon.

facing financial ruin [Nick was down on his luck, in debt, and a hair away from total financial ruin.]
racism in society [There was pointed racism in the dialogue. Nick and Eddie explicitly discussed racial tensions between whites and blacks. Nick admonished the Latin American cleaning lady Emilia for insulting him in her native tongue, instead of in English. Nick made slurs against Latinos and told Emilia that she should at least make an effort to insult him in English if she had to come to his country. This was perhaps the sin for which he died in the end.]
the role of war veterans in society [Nick and Eddie were both veterans form the Vietnam war. We saw how their fortunes were and heard that, at least in Nick's case, he derived them from what had happened to him during the war.]
coping with being in debt [Nick was struggling to pay off a debt of some sort without getting bonked on the head with a hammer again.]
poetic justice [Nick had taken no pity on Emilia, and indeed taunted her in her misfortune. When he was desperately fleeing a betentacled demon in the end, she repaid the favor in almost exactly the same way and using the very same prop: the broken padlock from her old unit.]

the Vietnam War [Nick and Eddie were both veterans of this war.]
historical event <Gulf War> [The story is set in the United States in 1991 at the outset of the Persian Gulf War. President George H. W. Bush was shown on television, announcing to the nation the beginning of offensive military operations against Iraq.]

Graveyard Rats

:: Date
2022-10-25

:: Description
In Salem, Massachusetts, graveyard caretaker Masson catches two grave robbers
stealing valuables from a corpse. At gunpoint he forces them to hand over the
stolen items while telling them that graveyards mark the start of human
civilization and will signal its end when people stop respecting the dead.
After the robbers leave, Masson continues to steal from the corpse by pulling
out a gold tooth. He drops the tooth and, while searching for it in the
coffin, is bitten by a rat. Masson takes the loot to Hans who says that lately
Masson has been coming up short. Masson tells him that rats have been stealing
valuables from the dead throughout the entire cemetery. Hans gives Masson one
week to pay back his debt. Masson goes to see city morgue employee Dooley for
tips on wealthy deceased slated for burial so as to steal their gold fillings.
Dooley is bribed with drugs and brings Masson into the embalming room, where
the last body is a wealthy merchant with a mouth full of gold teeth. Masson
goes insane trying to get them and Dooley convinces him to come back the next
day to keep the coroner from asking questions and giving away the scheme. The
deceased man's family arrives and Masson and Dooley spy as the widow
designates that he should be buried with medals and his expensive sword from
King George V. After the funeral, Masson digs up the grave to witness rats
taking the body. Fearing what Hans' punishment for failing to pay, Masson,
despite suffering from claustrophobia, crawls in after the body. He is chased
by a pack of rats that attack and bite him and scares them off firing his gun.
Hearing a growl in the tunnel, a giant hairless rat corners him. Masson shoots
the giant rat but it claws and chases him through the tunnels until he falls
into a hole ending up on a pile of human bones. Masson is thrilled when he
finds valuable jewelry and the sword. He realizes that he is inside a stone
structure in front of an altar to a demonic entity, a place Masson calls "The
Black Church." He sees a dessicated body with a beautiful gold pendant which
he tries to take. The body animates and attacks a screaming Masson and repeats
"Mine!". Masson escapes, with the zombie following him into a tunnel where the
giant rat is waiting. They fight and Masson is victorious. Masson sees a light
and crawls towards it, but it turns out to be a reflection from his lamp
against a plate on a coffin. The rats attack Masson. Later, the grave robbers
dig up the coffin and find Masson's body with the jewels, but rats crawl out
of his mouth when they try to take the loot.

The Autopsy

:: Date
2022-10-26

:: Description
Dr. Carl Winters, an elderly forensic pathologist suffering from terminal
stomach cancer, travels to a small town to perform autopsies on a group of 10
men killed by an explosion in a local coal mine. Winters' friend, local
sheriff Nate Craven, recounts for him the events leading up to the explosion:
After a string of missing-persons cases, Craven and his deputies settle on a
suspect named Elliott Sykes, a man who had himself gone missing from a
neighboring town, only to turn up working for the local coal mine under the
assumed name Joe Allen. Craven searches Sykes' hotel room, finding a strange
orb-like object, which he confiscates. Later, at the coal mine, Sykes steals
back the object and flees into the mine, triggering an explosion that kills
Sykes and 9 other miners. Setting up a makeshift morgue in an abandoned
slaughterhouse, Winters begins performing the autopsies, documenting his
findings on a tape recorder. As the autopsies continue, Winters begins
noticing that the bodies are all completely drained of their blood. Soon, the
corpse of Sykes reanimates and reveals to Winters that he is the host for a
parasitic alien. The alien, who feeds on human blood, but is near-starvation
due to Sykes' death, seeks to transfer into Winters' body to continue living.
Winters resists, but the alien incapacitates him and restrains him on the
operating table. Winters regains consciousness as Sykes begins to perform an
autopsy on himself, in order to maintain the appearance that Winters had
completed his job, and to give the alien easy exit from the corpse. As the
alien leaves Sykes' body and rigor mortis sets in, Winters is able to obtain
the scalpel, which he uses to sabotage his senses of sight and hearing, as
well as slitting his major arteries. With the blood, Winters writes a message
on his chest. As the alien takes control of his body, Winters informs it that
the body is near-death, effectively trapping the alien with no food source. He
also reveals that his tape recorder was left on, and has recorded much of his
interactions with the alien. Winters collapses on the floor as his heartbeat
slows to a stop. Craven arrives to find Winters' body, with the words: "PLAY
THE TAPE. BURN ME." written on his chest in blood.

:: Description
Awkward and unattractive bank teller Stacey Chapman is invited to a Christmas
party by her co-worker, Gina. At the party, Stacey feels excluded by her vain
and gossiping colleagues, and is further humiliated when her secret Santa gift
of a taxidermied duck is received unenthusiastically. Gina gifts each party-
goer a box of Alo Glo, an expensive and popular skin lotion. Upon applying the
lotion, Stacey finds that it severely irritates her skin. Stacey's husband
Keith tries to boost her self-esteem, but is unsuccessful. Discouraged and
unable to sleep, Stacey stays up watching television, only to happen across a
commercial for Alo Glo. Stacey soon realizes that the ad's spokesman is
talking directly to her, promising her that Alo Glo will make her beautiful if
she continues to use it, going so far to say that it will make her a "new
you." Stacey secretly orders a case of the lotion, and continues to use it,
despite the irritation. Stacey soon finds that the tubes of Alo Glo have begun
bursting, creating a puddle of lotion in her basement. A humanoid figure
emerges from the puddle, mirroring Stacey's movements. Sensing familiarity
with the figure, Stacey kisses and embraces it. Keith finally attempts to
confront Stacey, but she stabs him in the forehead before killing him with an
axe. Stacey then finds the lotion-figure in the bathroom, where it
disintegrates back into lotion in her bathtub. Stacey submerges herself in the
lotion, and re-emerges beautiful. Stacey taxidermies Keith's body, disposing
of his organs in the garbage. The next day, Stacey's co-workers are struck by
her newfound beauty. Stacey laughs and gossips with them, but soon is
overtaken with a sense of unease.

spouse murder [Stacey ended up putting a knife in her husbands prefrontal cortex, lodged an axe in his back, and then taxidermied his body, all because he didn't approve of her recklessly dowsing herself in a peculiar cream to which she seamed to be allergic but which she was convinced made her beautiful.]
descent into madness [At her coworker's Christmas party, Stacey was gifted a beauty cream that seemed to prompt an allergic reaction. In fact, through a peculiar combination of effects, it hooked Stacey on applying evermore of it and then made her become more and more unhinged. At one point she became convinced that her television was talking to her. She ended up killing and taxidermising her husband.]
magic potion [One interpretation of the story is that Stacy was completely sane and did not hallucinate. Evidence: The beautification process did things, like straightening her teeth, that could not have been a psychological effect.

:: Description
In 1979, novelist Guy Landon, astrophysicist Charlotte Xie, musician Randall
Roth, and psychic Targ Reinhard receive invitations from enigmatic billionaire
Lionel Lassiter, for a viewing at his mansion, The Sandpiper House. The group
is escorted to the house by Lassiter's assistant, Hector, and are received by
Lassiter's personal physician, Doctor Zahra. Lassiter soon joins them, sharing
a unique bottle of whiskey. As the group drinks and takes drugs, prepared for
them by Zahra, Lassiter expresses his admiration for each guest's talents and
accomplishments. When asked for information regarding himself or his past
Lassiter remains vague, instead choosing to point out the uniqueness and
singularity of his possessions, including his house, his music, and Zahra
herself. Lassiter soon takes them to a room he dubs "The Obelisk Chamber", in
which Lassiter displays a strange, rock-like object. Charlotte remarks on its
similarities to meteorites, though the object appears to have none of the
damage that meteorites would have. Targ claims to sense a psychic energy
within the object, while Landon is unimpressed. Lassiter claims that the
object is impervious to X-Rays and carbon dating. Despite Lassiter's wishes,
Randall repeatedly smokes near the object. The object appears to absorb the
smoke, and soon crumbles away, revealing a horned, slime-like creature within.
The creature kills Targ, Guy, and Zahra before absorbing Lassiter's body and
electrocuting Hector after he shoots it with an AK-47. Randall and Charlotte
successfully escape the mansion, and confirm to each other that the events
they witnessed were, in fact, real. The creature wanders from the mansion and
into a culvert, later emerging from a storm drain in a crowded, urban area.

:: Title
The Murmuring

:: Date
2022-10-28

:: Description
Nancy and Edgar Bradley are ornithologists studying bird murmurations and who
recently lost their daughter Ava. They go to a remote country home to continue
their studies and get away from their grief. Nancy begins seeing ghostly
apparitions of a crying boy and a screaming angry woman. Edgar believes these
visions are from the strain of her grief, which Nancy's kept inside all
throughout. Nancy learns that the former owner, Claudette, drowned her son and
committed suicide. During a fight over these visions, Edgar expresses
frustration over Nancy never crying following Ava's death, nor wishing to talk
about it, and his hopelessness over their strained relationship. Despondent,
he leaves for his research site the next morning. Alone, Nancy is chased by
Claudette's screaming ghost and hears her son crying that his mother is angry
with him. Comforting him, Nancy encourages him to run into her arms. He does,
finally passing on. Nancy then witnesses Claudette committing suicide,
realizing that her angry screams were in despair over drowning her son.
Claudette's spirit is carried by an enormous bird murmuration, which envelops
Nancy, allowing her to finally cry and confront her grief. She contacts a
relieved Edgar, saying she is finally ready to talk about Ava.
