speculative ability [Each mutant was endowed with a unique super power.]

:: Major Themes
telepathic ability [Much was made of Xavier's' ability to read people minds and communicate with others telepathically. Emma Frost was an extremely strong mutant telepath.]
mind reading ability [Unlike pervious films in the series, much was made of Xavier's ability to read the thoughts of other people. The powerful mutant Emma Frost also manifested this ability.]
telekinetic ability [Erik had an innate ability to control metal objects at a distance. His grandest feat was to raise a nuclear submarine out from the sea.]
shapeshifting [Raven had an innate ability to alter her shape and voice to mimic any human being.]
the Cold War [The film presents an alternative history of the Cuban Missile Crisis where a secret society of mutants attempts to manipulate the Soviet Union and the USA into engaging in a nuclear exchange, clearing the path for mutants to become the dominant species on the planet.]
nuclear holocaust [Sebastian Shaw plotted to manipulate the Soviet Union and the USA into engaging in a humanity destroying nuclear exchanged, clearing a path for the rise of the mutants.]
friendship [We saw the beginnings of Xavier and Erik's friendship. Xavier and Raven had been friends since childhood, but in the end she followed her conscience and went of with Erik.]
being ashamed of who you are [Raven was disguised herself as a beautiful woman because she was ashamed to present herself in her true form: a blue-skinned person with red hair.]
nuclear weapons [Sebastian Shaw plotted to manipulate the Soviet Union and the USA into engaging in a humanity destroying nuclear exchanged, clearing a path for the rise of the mutants.]
xenophobia in society [Eirk warned that the humans would persecute mutants in the very same way that the Nazis has persecuted the Jews. And, indeed, the US and Soviet forces to kill the mutants in a joint missile strike on them.]
leadership [Xavier and Erik were contrasted as very different types of leaders in the mutant cause.]

:: Minor Themes
The Holocaust [The film opened depicting a young Erik's experience inside a Nazi concentration camp.]
teleportation ability [The Devil resembling mutant Azazel had an innate ability to teleport.]
mind attack ability [Emma Frost briefly crippled Xavier with a psionic attack on his mind.]
flying ability [Angel Salvadore was a mutant with dragonfly wings. Sean harnessed his ability to shoot concentrated sonic bursts to be able to fly around in the sky.]
mind control ability [Xavier psionically manipulated a Soviet ship captain into blowing up one of his own cargo ships.]
the desire to be beautiful [The blue-skinned mutant Raven disguised herself as a beautiful woman.]
true beauty comes from within [Erik convinced Raven that she ought to embrace her freakish (as judged by society) blue-skinned self, rather than go on masquerading as a beautiful woman (again as judge by society).]
speculative evolution [Xavier discussed some aspects of the evolution of mutants in the context of his doctoral thesis.]
directed energy shooting ability [Alex had the ability absorb energy and discharge it in blasts. Sean had an innate ability to shoot concentrated sound waves.]
