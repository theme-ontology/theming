I vitelloni (Italian pronunciation: ; lit. "The Bullocks/The layabouts") is a
1953 Italian comedy-drama directed by Federico Fellini from a screenplay by
Fellini, Ennio Flaiano and Tullio Pinelli. The film launched the career of
Alberto Sordi, one of post-war Italy's most significant and popular comedians,
who stars with Franco Fabrizi and Franco Interlenghi in a story of five young
Italian men at crucial turning points in their small town lives. Recognized as
a pivotal work in the director's artistic evolution, the film has distinct
autobiographical elements that mirror important societal changes in 1950s
Italy. Recipient of both the Venice Film Festival Silver Lion in 1953, and an
Academy Award nomination for Best Writing in 1958, the film's success restored
Fellini's reputation after the commercial failure of The White Sheik (1952).

up among an eccentric cast of characters in the village of Borgo San Giuliano
(situated near the ancient walls of Rimini) in 1930s Fascist Italy. The film's

title then became a neologism of the Italian language, with the meaning of
'nostalgic revocation'. The titular role of Titta is indeed based off of
Fellini's childhood friend from Remini, Luigi Titta Benzi. Benzi became a
lawyer and remained in close contact with Fellini throughout his life.
