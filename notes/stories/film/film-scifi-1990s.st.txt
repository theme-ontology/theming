The story takes place several centuries in the future. Mankind has colonized

hunger, and overpopulation have been eliminated. However, boredom spread
rapidly throughout the galaxy and as a result, interstellar war broke out. The
two opposing factions were the Galactic Republic and the Rebels. While the
Rebels eventually defeated the Galactic Republic because of their far greater
numbers, the former were no better off; the aftermath of that war was a new
Dark Age. Houses, plantations, and, more importantly, most books were
destroyed in the war, and knowledge of interstellar travel was mostly lost,
available only to a privileged few. Mankind, in the film, had made much
progress, only to be rewarded with "third world" living conditions, despite
