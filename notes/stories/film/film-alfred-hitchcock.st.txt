:: Description
The Mountain Eagle is a 1926 silent drama film, and Alfred Hitchcock's second
as director, following The Pleasure Garden. The film, a romantic melodrama set
in Kentucky, is about a widower who jealously competes with his crippled son
and a man he loathes over the affections of a schoolteacher. The film was
mostly produced at the Emelka Film studios in Munich, Germany in autumn of
1925, with exterior scenes shot in the village of Obergurgl in the State of
Tyrol, Austria. Production was plagued with problems, including the
destruction of a village roof and Hitchcock experiencing altitude sickness.
Due to producing the film in Germany, Hitchcock had more directorial freedom
than he would have had in England, and he was influenced by German cinematic
style and technique.
