All Quiet on the Western Front is a 1930 American pre-Code epic anti-war film based on the 1929 novel of the same name by German novelist Erich Maria Remarque. Directed by Lewis Milestone, it stars Lew Ayres, Louis Wolheim, John Wray, Slim Summerville, and William Bakewell.

The film opened to wide acclaim in the United States. Considered a realistic and harrowing account of warfare in World War I, it made the American Film Institute's first 100 Years...100 Movies list in 1997. A decade later, after the same organization polled over 1,501 workers in the creative community, All Quiet on the Western Front was ranked the seventh-best American epic film.

:: Choice Themes
the horrors of war [Arguably the main point of the story is to show how awful the realities of war can be. Scenes showed soldiers starving and pilfering. Scenes showed soldiers being mowed down by machine guns. Scenes showed soldiers suffering dismemberment. The main character, Paul, ended up being killed by a sniper as Paul reached out of his hiding place to touch a butterfly.]

:: Major Themes

commander and subordinate [The young recruits had various run-ins with Sergeant Himmelstoss.]
military related work [The story concerns German rank and file military men during the First World War.]
coping with the death of a friend [Paul was devastated when his friend Kat was killed shortly after they had just reunited.] {FD seemed like it must have been there more, but couldn't pin downS specific cases.}
patriotism [Professor Kantorek appealed to his students sense of patriotism in order to make them join the war effort as soldiers. Paul came back to refute his professor and stated that it's better not to die at all than to die for one's country.]

mathematics [A soldier studied the geometric series and spelled out the formula for its sum.]
the pleasure of good boots []
cowardice [Himmelstoss showed himself to be a coward, and was scolded for it. Paul was called a coward by his old teacher when Paul refused to glorify the war.]
respect for an enemy [Paul stabbrd a French soldier and then cared for the slowly dying man as they hunkered down together in a shell-hole. Thus he came to see that the enemy was as human as himself.]
remorse [Paul begged the corpse of the French soldier he had stabbed for forgiveness.]
the need for companionship [Four soldiers showed themselves desperate for female companionship. They braved court martial to sneak out and meet some.]
