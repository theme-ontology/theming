:: Description
Cimarron is a 1931 pre-Code epic Western film starring Richard Dix and Irene Dunne, and directed by Wesley Ruggles. Released by RKO, it won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay (written by Howard Estabrook and based on Edna Ferber's 1930 novel Cimarron), and Best Production Design (by Max Rée).

Both Dix and Dunne were nominated for their leading roles, and Edward Cronjager for Best Cinematography, but did not win. Estelle Taylor, Edna May Oliver, and Roscoe Ates appeared in supporting roles. Epic in scope, spanning forty years from 1889 to 1929, Cimarron was RKO's most expensive production up to that date, as well as its first production to win the Best Picture Oscar. It was a critical success, although it did not recoup its production costs during its initial run in 1931.

:: Choice Themes
the need for adventure [The hero of the story Yancey Crevat was driven by an unquenchable thirst for adventure. After settling in the booming frontier town of Osage with his family, he built a successful career as a newspaper publisher. The spirit of adventure, however, soon got the better of him and he irresponsibly bolted on his wife and children to settle land in the newly opened Cherokee Strip. From that point on one gathers that Yancey became an adventure seeking drifter. The viewer later learns, for instance, that he went off to fight in the Spanish-American War.]

:: Major Themes
heroism [Yancey was a heroic adventurer. He was lauded as a hero by the people of Osage for almost single-handedly taking down a gang of bandits who were causing a ruckus in the town. The story concluded the people of Osage raising a statue of Yancey to honor him.]

female independence [Sabra took over running the publication after Yancey bolted for the Cherokee Strip. Later, she became the first female member of Congress.]

racism in society [Racist tropes were raised about Blacks (e.g., Yancey emphasized the abundance of watermelons in Oklahoma to Isiah). Racist slurs leveled against the Native Americans (e.g., Sabra rebuffed Cim for talking to "dirty, filthy Indians") and people of mixed race (e.g., Yancey referred to some people as "half-breeds").]
father and son [Yancey was doing a fine job raising his son, Cim, until Yancey took off to settle land in the newly opened Cherokee Strip.]
mother and son [Sabra raised her young son, Cim. Later in life, Sabra put her foot down when Cim announced his intention to marry the Cherokee girl Ruby. However, Sabra accepted Ruby in the end.]
coping with having a speech disorder [Jesse Rickey had a serious stuttering problem.] {PS: Only used one time in IC? What gives?}

what it is like in a legal proceeding [In a dramatic trial, Dixie Lee was acquitted of being a public nuisance.]
bigamy [On the witness stand, Dixie Lee reluctantly shared with the court that she'd once unknowingly tied the knot with a married man.]
fate [] {For discussion: Sabra had a moment of clarity when she mused that the life she led could have been Dixie had things been different. Search "she might be like I am" in the transcript.}
disapproving parent [Sabra disapproved of Cim marrying the Cherokee girl Ruby. However, Sabra came to accept Ruby in the end.]

:: Choice Themes
carpe diem [A moral of the story is arguably that which Kringelein spelled out while drunk after gambling: That one must have the courage to seize life and live it to its fullest.]
what if I had only one day to live [Kringelein believed he had only weeks left to live. He intended to do as much living as possible while he could, and damn the expense.]

:: Major Themes
the hospitality industry [The story is set in the Berlin Grand Hotel.]
coping with a terminal illness [Otto Kringelein had had a terminal prognosis and was intent on spending the remaining few days of his life in luxury.]
theft [Baron von Gaigern planned to steal Grusinskaya's pearls, Kringelein's pocketbook, and finally and ill-fatedly Preysing's pocketbook.]
romantic love [Baron von Gaigern and Grusinskaya fell passionately in love.]
compromising one's ethical principles vs. great need [Baron von Gaigern needed money greatly to pay his way out of a criminal group. However, his scruples got in the way first when he tried to burglarize Grusinskaya's room, and then again when he tried to rob Kringelein.]
desperation [The story had several desperate characters at the center, each desperate in their own way. Kringelein had been given only weeks to live. Baron von Gaigern needed money to pay off criminals. Grusinskaya was unable to dance. Preysing had to get the merger through or his company would go under.]
gambling [Gambling was one of Baron von Gaigern's many vices, and one he turned to in desperation when he needed money to pay off criminals]

what if I killed someone by accident [Preysing was arrested after he clubbed Baron von Gaigern to death with a telephone receiver in a fit of blind rage. Preysing was likely justified in trying to prevent the baron from leaving, but clearly used more force than he meant to. The baron had tried to pilfer a pocketbook full of money from Preysing's room.]
master and pet [Baron von Gaigern instructed a bellhop to take his dog out for a walk.]
coping with being disfigured [The right side of Dr. Otternschlag's face was hideously scarred from a grenade explosion that occurred when he was serving as a physician in the Great War.]
