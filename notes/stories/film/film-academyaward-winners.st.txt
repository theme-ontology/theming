When he realized that he was being outmaneuvered by his unscrupulous political adversaries he decided to become more Machiavellian himself. He became a populist, and eventually was elected governor.

movie: Going My Way (1944)
==========================

:: Title
Going My Way

:: Date
1944-05-03

:: Description
Going My Way is a 1944 American musical comedy drama film directed by Leo
McCarey and starring Bing Crosby and Barry Fitzgerald. Written by Frank Butler
and Frank Cavett, based on a story by McCarey, the film is about a new young
priest taking over a parish from an established old veteran. Crosby sings five
songs with other songs performed onscreen by Metropolitan Opera's star mezzo-
soprano Risë Stevens and the Robert Mitchell Boys Choir. Going My Way was the
highest-grossing picture of 1944, and was nominated for ten Academy Awards,
winning seven, including Best Picture. Its success helped to make movie
exhibitors choose Crosby as the biggest box-office draw of the year, a record
he would hold for the remainder of the 1940s. After World War II, Crosby and
McCarey presented a copy of the film to Pope Pius XII at the Vatican. Going My
Way was followed the next year by a sequel, The Bells of St. Mary's.

In 2004, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National
Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically,
or aesthetically significant".

:: Choice Themes
personal human experience [Dr_ Otternschlag, also the narrator, both prefaced and concluded this story by saying that "Nothing ever happens" at the Grand Hotel. The story pointedly refuted this statement implying that the real theme was in fact this: There is drama and intrigue everywhere around us if we only care to look.]
carpe diem [A moral of the story is arguably that which Kringelein spelled out while drunk after gambling: That one must have the courage to seize life and live it to its fullest.]

:: Major Themes
the hospitality industry [The story is set in the Berlin Grand Hotel. Among other things Kringelein argured with the staff over the quality of his room and managed to get it up graded to a suite.]
coping with a terminal illness [Kringelein had had a terminal prognosis and was intent on spending the remaining few weeks or months of his life in luxury.]
what if I had only one day to live [Kringelein believed he had only weeks or months left to live. He intended to do as much living as possible while he could, and damn the expense.]
theft [Baron von Gaigern attempted to steal Grusinskaya's pearls, Kringelein's pocketbook, and finally and ill-fatedly Preysing's pocketbook.]
romantic love [Baron von Gaigern and Grusinskaya fell passionately in love.]
compromising one's ethical principles vs. great need [Baron von Gaigern desperately needed money to pay his way out of a criminal group. However, his scruples got in the way first when he tried to burglarize Grusinskaya's room, and then again when he tried to rob Kringelein. In both cases he aborted his attempt because of his conscience.]
desperation [The story had several desperate characters at the center, each desperate in their own way. Kringelein had been given only weeks or months to live. Baron von Gaigern needed money to pay off criminals. Preysing had to get the merger through or his company would go under.]
coping with being in debt [Baron von Gaigern plotted to steal a pearl necklace to fulfill a 5,000 Mark debt that he owed.]
facing financial ruin [Preysing had to get the merger through or his company would go under, leaving him in dire straights. Baron von Gaigern was broke and indebted to gangsters, and therefore would not be able to maintain his lavish lifestyle for much longer.]
boss and employee [Kringelein and Mr. Preysing had several run ins and a major confrontation in the hotel bar regarding their unequal social status.]

:: Minor Themes
mother and son [Preysing spoke to his mother on the phone.]
father and son [Preysing spoke to his father on the phone.]
dancing [Grusinskaya was a Russian ballerina.]
medical occupation [Dr. Otternschlag, also the narrator, observed the happenings at the hotel. He also aided Kringelein.]
flirtation [Baron von Gaigern flirted shamelessly with Mrs. Flaemmchen, the stenographer.]
coping with insomnia [Grusinskaya had been unable to sleep the night before her big performance.]
what if I murdered someone in a fit of rage [Preysing was arrested after he clubbed Baron von Gaigern to death with a telephone receiver in a fit of blind rage. Preysing was likely justified in trying to prevent the baron from leaving, but clearly used more force than he meant to. The baron had tried to pilfer a pocketbook full of money from Preysing's room.]
master and pet [Baron von Gaigern instructed a bellhop to take his dog out for a walk.]
coping with being disfigured [The right side of Dr. Otternschlag's face was hideously scarred from a grenade explosion that had occurred when he was serving as a physician in the Great War.]
World War I [Dr. Otternschlag revealed that he'd served as a front line physician in the Great War.]
coping with unwelcome romantic attention [Mrs. Flaemmche rebuffed Mr. Preysing's romantic advances.]
gambling [Gambling was one of Baron von Gaigern's many vices, and one he turned to in desperation when he needed money to pay off criminals.]
negotiation [The industrial tycoon Mr. Preysing was spearheading a merger that, if successful, would save his company from going under. He stooped to lying about good news having come in from Manchester in a desperate bid to get the deal done.]


movie: Hamlet (1948)
====================

:: Title
Hamlet

:: Date
1948-05-04

:: Description
Hamlet is a 1948 British film adaptation of William Shakespeare's play of the
same name, adapted, directed by and starring Laurence Olivier. Hamlet was
Olivier's second film as director and the second of the three Shakespeare
films that he directed (the 1936 As You Like It had starred Olivier, but had
been directed by Paul Czinner). Hamlet was the first British film to win the
Academy Award for Best Picture. It is the first sound film of the play in
English.

Olivier's Hamlet is the Shakespeare film that has received the most
prestigious accolades, winning the Academy Award for Best Picture and Best
Actor and the Golden Lion at the 9th Venice International Film Festival.
However, it proved controversial among Shakespearean purists, who felt that
Olivier had made too many alterations and excisions to the four-hour play by
cutting one-and-a-half-hours' worth of content. Milton Shulman wrote in The
Evening Standard: "To some it will be one of the greatest films ever made, to
others a deep disappointment. Laurence Olivier leaves no doubt that he is one
of our greatest living actors... his liberties with the text, however, are
sure to disturb many."

movie: The Life of Emile Zola (1937)
====================================

:: Title
The Life of Emile Zola

:: Date
1937-08-11

:: Description
The Life of Emile Zola is a 1937 American biographical film about the 19th-
century French author Émile Zola starring Paul Muni and directed by William
Dieterle.

It premiered at the Los Angeles Carthay Circle Theatre to great critical and
financial success. Contemporary reviews ranked it as the greatest biographical
film made up to that time.

In 2000, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film
Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or
aesthetically significant."

Produced during the Great Depression and after the Nazi Party had taken power
in Germany, the film failed to explore the key issue of antisemitic injustice
in France in the late 19th century, when Zola became involved in the Dreyfus
affair and worked to gain the officer's release. Some recent studies have
noted the film as an example of Hollywood's timidity at the time: antisemitism
was not mentioned in the film, nor was "Jew" said in dialogue. Some explicitly
anti-Nazi films were canceled in this period, and other content was modified.
This was also the period when Hollywood had established the Production Code,
establishing an internal censor, in response to perceived threats of external
censorship.

The Life of Emile Zola became the second biographical film to win the Academy
Award for Best Picture.
