:: Description
Cimarron is a 1931 pre-Code epic Western film starring Richard Dix and Irene Dunne, and directed by Wesley Ruggles. Released by RKO, it won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay (written by Howard Estabrook and based on Edna Ferber's 1930 novel Cimarron), and Best Production Design (by Max RÃ©e).

Both Dix and Dunne were nominated for their leading roles, and Edward Cronjager for Best Cinematography, but did not win. Estelle Taylor, Edna May Oliver, and Roscoe Ates appeared in supporting roles. Epic in scope, spanning forty years from 1889 to 1929, Cimarron was RKO's most expensive production up to that date, as well as its first production to win the Best Picture Oscar. It was a critical success, although it did not recoup its production costs during its initial run in 1931.

:: Choice Themes
the need for adventure [The hero of the story Yancey Crevat was driven by an unquenchable thirst for adventure. After settling in the booming frontier town of Osage with his family, he built a successful career as a newspaper publisher. The spirit of adventure, however, soon got the better of him and he irresponsibly bolted on his wife and children to settle land in the newly opened Cherokee Strip. From that point on one gathers that Yancey became an adventure seeking drifter. The viewer later learns, for instance, that he went off to fight in the Spanish-American War.]

:: Major Themes

female independence [Sabra took over running the publication after Yancey bolted for the Cherokee Strip. Later, she became the first female member of Congress.]

racism in society [Racist tropes were raised about Blacks (e.g., Yancey emphasized the abundance of watermelons in Oklahoma to Isiah). Racist slurs leveled against the Native Americans (e.g., Sabra rebuffed Cim for talking to "dirty, filthy Indians") and people of mixed race (e.g., Yancey referred to some people as "half-breeds").]
father and son [Yancey was doing a fine job raising his son, Cim, until Yancey took off to settle land in the newly opened Cherokee Strip.]
mother and son [Sabra raised her young son, Cim. Later in life, Sabra put her foot down when Cim announced his intention to marry the Cherokee girl Ruby. However, Sabra accepted Ruby in the end.]
coping with having a speech disorder [Jesse Rickey had a serious stuttering problem.] {PS: Only used one time in IC? What gives?}

what it is like in a legal proceeding [In a dramatic trial, Dixie Lee was acquitted of being a public nuisance.]
bigamy [On the witness stand, Dixie Lee reluctantly shared with the court that she'd once unknowingly tied the knot with a married man.]
fate [] {For discussion: Sabra had a moment of clarity when she mused that the life she led could have been Dixie had things been different. Search "she might be like I am" in the transcript.}
disapproving parent [Sabra disapproved of Cim marrying the Cherokee girl Ruby. However, Sabra came to accept Ruby in the end.]
politics [Yancey made an abortive run for the Oklahoma governorship. Sabra was celebrated for winning a seat in Congress.]
corruption [While running for governor, Yancey chided Mr. Leary for perpetrating dirty political schemes.]

:: Choice Themes
personal human experience [Dr_ Otternschlag, also the narrator, both prefaced and concluded this story by saying that "Nothing ever happens" at the Grand Hotel. The story pointedly refuted this statement implying that the real theme was in fact this: There is drama and intrigue everywhere around us if we only care to look.]
carpe diem [A moral of the story is arguably that which Kringelein spelled out while drunk after gambling: That one must have the courage to seize life and live it to its fullest.]

:: Major Themes
the hospitality industry [The story is set in the Berlin Grand Hotel. Among other things Kringelein argured with the staff over the quality of his room and managed to get it up graded to a suite.]
coping with a terminal illness [Kringelein had had a terminal prognosis and was intent on spending the remaining few weeks or months of his life in luxury.]
what if I had only one day to live [Kringelein believed he had only weeks or months left to live. He intended to do as much living as possible while he could, and damn the expense.]
theft [Baron von Gaigern attempted to steal Grusinskaya's pearls, Kringelein's pocketbook, and finally and ill-fatedly Preysing's pocketbook.]
romantic love [Baron von Gaigern and Grusinskaya fell passionately in love.]
compromising one's ethical principles vs. great need [Baron von Gaigern desperately needed money to pay his way out of a criminal group. However, his scruples got in the way first when he tried to burglarize Grusinskaya's room, and then again when he tried to rob Kringelein. In both cases he aborted his attempt because of his conscience.]
desperation [The story had several desperate characters at the center, each desperate in their own way. Kringelein had been given only weeks or months to live. Baron von Gaigern needed money to pay off criminals. Preysing had to get the merger through or his company would go under.]
coping with being in debt [Baron von Gaigern plotted to steal a pearl necklace to fulfill a 5,000 Mark debt that he owed.]
facing financial ruin [Preysing had to get the merger through or his company would go under, leaving him in dire straights. Baron von Gaigern was broke and indebted to gangsters, and therefore would not be able to maintain his lavish lifestyle for much longer.]
boss and employee [Kringelein and Mr. Preysing had several run ins and a major confrontation in the hotel bar regarding their unequal social status.]

:: Minor Themes
mother and son [Preysing spoke to his mother on the phone.]
father and son [Preysing spoke to his father on the phone.]
dancing [Grusinskaya was a Russian ballerina.]
medical occupation [Dr. Otternschlag, also the narrator, observed the happenings at the hotel. He also aided Kringelein.]
flirtation [Baron von Gaigern flirted shamelessly with Mrs. Flaemmchen, the stenographer.]
coping with insomnia [Grusinskaya had been unable to sleep the night before her big performance.]
what if I murdered someone in a fit of rage [Preysing was arrested after he clubbed Baron von Gaigern to death with a telephone receiver in a fit of blind rage. Preysing was likely justified in trying to prevent the baron from leaving, but clearly used more force than he meant to. The baron had tried to pilfer a pocketbook full of money from Preysing's room.]
master and pet [Baron von Gaigern instructed a bellhop to take his dog out for a walk.]
coping with being disfigured [The right side of Dr. Otternschlag's face was hideously scarred from a grenade explosion that had occurred when he was serving as a physician in the Great War.]
World War I [Dr. Otternschlag revealed that he'd served as a front line physician in the Great War.]
coping with unwelcome romantic attention [Mrs. Flaemmche rebuffed Mr. Preysing's romantic advances.]
gambling [Gambling was one of Baron von Gaigern's many vices, and one he turned to in desperation when he needed money to pay off criminals.]
negotiation [The industrial tycoon Mr. Preysing was spearheading a merger that, if successful, would save his company from going under. He stooped to lying about good news having come in from Manchester in a desperate bid to get the deal done.]

the horrors of war [Two wars transformed the lives of the two families at the center of the story.

social inequality [Arguably a point of the story was to compare and contrast the wealthy Marryot family with the poorer family of their butler, the Bridges.]
human aspiration [Fanny had a strong passion for dancing from the time she was a little girl, and eventually made a career out of it.]
romantic love [Edward and Edith fell in love and got married, but their lives took a tragic turn when they chose to honeymoon aboard the Titanic.

parent and child [Robert and Jane, the patriarch and matriarch of the Marryot family, raised their two boys to adulthood. Alfred and Ellen likewise raised their daughter, Fanny, to womanhood.]

:: Minor Themes

coping with the death of a child [Jane fainted upon reading a telegram conveying the terrible news of her beloved son Joe's death in combat.]
coping with being blind [In a brief scene, blind veterans of the Great War were shown learning how to read braille and weave baskets.]
sexual norms in society [In a brief nightclub scene, two young women were shown flirting with each other, and likewise with two young gentlemen. In the context of the 1920s, which was the era in which the scene was set, this behavior would have been considered morally depraved.]
