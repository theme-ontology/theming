:: Choice Themes
personal human experience [Dr_ Otternschlag, also the narrator, both prefaced and concluded this story by saying that "Nothing ever happens" at the Grand Hotel. The story pointedly refuted this statement implying that the real theme was in fact this: There is drama and intrigue everywhere around us if we only care to look.]
carpe diem [A moral of the story is arguably that which Kringelein spelled out while drunk after gambling: That one must have the courage to seize life and live it to its fullest.]

:: Major Themes
the hospitality industry [The story is set in the Berlin Grand Hotel. Among other things Kringelein argured with the staff over the quality of his room and managed to get it up graded to a suite.]
coping with a terminal illness [Kringelein had had a terminal prognosis and was intent on spending the remaining few weeks or months of his life in luxury.]
what if I had only one day to live [Kringelein believed he had only weeks or months left to live. He intended to do as much living as possible while he could, and damn the expense.]
theft [Baron von Gaigern attempted to steal Grusinskaya's pearls, Kringelein's pocketbook, and finally and ill-fatedly Preysing's pocketbook.]
romantic love [Baron von Gaigern and Grusinskaya fell passionately in love.]
compromising one's ethical principles vs. great need [Baron von Gaigern desperately needed money to pay his way out of a criminal group. However, his scruples got in the way first when he tried to burglarize Grusinskaya's room, and then again when he tried to rob Kringelein. In both cases he aborted his attempt because of his conscience.]
desperation [The story had several desperate characters at the center, each desperate in their own way. Kringelein had been given only weeks or months to live. Baron von Gaigern needed money to pay off criminals. Preysing had to get the merger through or his company would go under.]
coping with being in debt [Baron von Gaigern plotted to steal a pearl necklace to fulfill a 5,000 Mark debt that he owed.]
facing financial ruin [Preysing had to get the merger through or his company would go under, leaving him in dire straights. Baron von Gaigern was broke and indebted to gangsters, and therefore would not be able to maintain his lavish lifestyle for much longer.]

:: Minor Themes
mother and son [Preysing spoke to his mother on the phone.]

dancing [Grusinskaya was a Russian ballerina.]
medical occupation [Dr. Otternschlag, also the narrator, observed the happenings at the hotel. He also aided Kringelein.]
flirtation [Baron von Gaigern flirted shamelessly with Mrs. Flaemmchen, the stenographer.]
coping with insomnia [Grusinskaya had been unable to sleep the night before her big performance.]
what if I murdered someone in a fit of rage [Preysing was arrested after he clubbed Baron von Gaigern to death with a telephone receiver in a fit of blind rage. Preysing was likely justified in trying to prevent the baron from leaving, but clearly used more force than he meant to. The baron had tried to pilfer a pocketbook full of money from Preysing's room.]
master and pet [Baron von Gaigern instructed a bellhop to take his dog out for a walk.]
coping with being disfigured [The right side of Dr. Otternschlag's face was hideously scarred from a grenade explosion that had occurred when he was serving as a physician in the Great War.]

coping with unwelcome romantic attention [Mrs. Flaemmche rebuffed Mr. Preysing's romantic advances.]
gambling [Gambling was one of Baron von Gaigern's many vices, and one he turned to in desperation when he needed money to pay off criminals.]

coping with being blind [In a brief scene, blind veterans of the Great War were shown learning how to read braille and weave baskets.]

movie: The Life of Emile Zola
=============================

:: Title
The Life of Emile Zola

:: Date
1937-08-11

:: Description
The Life of Emile Zola is a 1937 American biographical film about the 19th-century French author Ãmile Zola starring Paul Muni and directed by William Dieterle.

It premiered at the Los Angeles Carthay Circle Theatre to great critical and financial success. Contemporary reviews ranked it as the greatest biographical film made up to that time.

In 2000, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."

Produced during the Great Depression and after the Nazi Party had taken power in Germany, the film failed to explore the key issue of antisemitic injustice in France in the late 19th century, when Zola became involved in the Dreyfus affair and worked to gain the officer's release. Some recent studies have noted the film as an example of Hollywood's timidity at the time: antisemitism was not mentioned in the film, nor was "Jew" said in dialogue. Some explicitly anti-Nazi films were canceled in this period, and other content was modified. This was also the period when Hollywood had established the Production Code, establishing an internal censor, in response to perceived threats of external censorship.

The Life of Emile Zola became the second biographical film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.
