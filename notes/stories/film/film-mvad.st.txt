:: Major Themes
what it is like in school [The story follows the buddy cops, Schmidt and Jenko, as they are forced to relive high school when they are assigned to go undercover as high school students to prevent the outbreak of a new synthetic drug and arrest its supplier.]
illegal drug trade [The buddy cops Schmidt and Jenko were tasked to infiltrate a local high school to prevent the outbreak of a new synthetic drug and arrest its supplier.]
law enforcement [The buddy cops Schmidt and Jenko were tasked to infiltrate a local high school to prevent the outbreak of a new synthetic drug and arrest its supplier.]
brother and brother [The buddy cops Schmidt and Jenko went undercover as the siblings Brad and Doug McQuaid, and in so doing lived as brothers in Schmidt's parents home.]
friendship [Schmidt and Jenko were fast friends, and their bonds of friendship increases throughout the story. Schmidt befriended the high school drug dealer, Eric, and they became pals of sorts. A shot DEA agent uttered some last words to his best friend before expiring.]
human characters in contrast [tall and handsome and dumb vs. short and average and dumb]
work partner and work partner [Schmidt and Jenko were partners on the force.]
the desire to be liked [Schmidt, a socially awkward police officer who'd been a big loser in high school, longed to be popular on his mission to infiltrate a local high school.]
coping with time passing you by [Much was made of high school having changed unrecognizability since Schmidt and Jenko's student days. For example, it was cool to carry your backpack with two straps instead of one, people texted instead of calling on the phone, bullying was no longer cool, caring about the environment was normal, etc.]
romantic love [Schmidt courted his drama class classmate Molly, winning her love in the end.]
betrayal [Schmidt befriended Eric to infiltrate his drug smuggling ring, only to reluctantly reveal himself to be a cop in the end. The DEA agent infiltrated the biker gang, and pointedly betrayed its boss at a critical moment.]

:: Minor Themes
racism in society [Captain Dickson made remarks to the effect that nobody would have cared about the kid who overdosed on drugs had he been black.]
Christianity [The titular 21 Jump Street program operated out of a derelict Korean church of the same street address. Schmidt stood before the "Korean Jesus" crucifix and vocalized a prayer to this savior of humanity.]
coping with humiliation [Schmidt was mortified at the sight of his baby/kid pictures on a wall of his parent's home, citing that he'd consulted a therapist multiple times over one particularly embarrassing one.]
peer pressure [On their first day undercover at the high school, Jenko urged Schmidt not succumb to peer pressure by keeping to lugging his backpack with one strap over the shoulder, instead of two, as everyone else was doing.]
environmentalism [While undercover at the high school, Schmidt and Jenko were surprised to learn that it was now cool to care about the environment, unlike back in their day.]
the theater [Schmidt played the role of Peter Pan in a high school production of this play.]
acting [Schmidt discovered he had a penchant for acting while taking the high school drama class. He ultimately played the lead role in the high school's theatrical production of Peter Pan.]
psychedelic experience [Schmidt and Jenko experienced trippy visual auditory hallucinations after ingesting the new "Holy Fucking Shit" synthetic drug.]
husband and wife [David and Annie Schmidt were happily married.]
parental pride [David and Annie Schmidt embarrassed their son, Schmidt, in front of his partner on the force with their excessive fawning over him.]
mother and son [The relationship between Annie and her adult son, Schmidt, was explored. Annie admonished Schmidt for having a wild house party while she was on vacation. She also nagged about doing such chores as mowing the lawn.]
father and son [David was an easy going dad to his son, Schmidt.]
getting fired from one's job [Schmidt and Jenko were fired from the force in the wake of the Peter Pan fiasco.]
freezing up in a critical moment [In the car chase scene, Schmidt froze up while aiming his gun at the motorcycle gang leader, resulting in Jenko having to pull the trigger himself self riving the car.]
student and teacher romance [The AP Chemistry teacher Ms. Griggs had a thing for her pupil, Jenko.]
jealousy [Jenko became increasingly jealous of Schmidt's blooming friendship with Eric.]
