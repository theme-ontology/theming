:: Description
Jeanne Dielman, 23, Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles is a 1975 arthouse film
by Belgian filmmaker Chantal Akerman.

Jeanne Dielman examines a single mother's regimented schedule of cooking,
cleaning and mothering over three days. The mother, Jeanne Dielman (whose name
is only derived from the title and from a letter she reads to her son), has
sex with male clients in her house daily for her and her son's subsistence.
Like her other activities, Jeanne's sex work is part of the routine she
performs every day by rote and is uneventful. But on the second and third day,
Jeanne's routine begins to unravel subtly, as she overcooks the potatoes that
she's preparing for dinner, and drops a newly washed spoon. These alterations
to Jeanne's existence prepare for the climax on the third day, during which
she murders a client.

:: Title
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

:: Date
1974-10-11

:: Description
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a 1974 American slasher film directed by Tobe
Hooper and written and co-produced by Hooper and Kim Henkel. It stars Marilyn
Burns, Paul A. Partain, Edwin Neal, Jim Siedow and Gunnar Hansen, who
respectively portray Sally Hardesty, Franklin Hardesty, the hitchhiker, the
proprietor, and Leatherface. The film follows a group of friends who fall
victim to a family of cannibals while on their way to visit an old homestead.
The film was marketed as being based on true events to attract a wider
audience and to act as a subtle commentary on the era's political climate;
although the character of Leatherface and minor story details were inspired by
the crimes of murderer Ed Gein, its plot is largely fictional.

Reiner. It stars Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer as
members of the fictional English heavy metal band Spinal Tap (who are
