pleasure in the misfortune of another [The Mandroid, Nora, and Kuji shared a laugh once it became apparent that the power hungry Abbot Reeves had not succeeded in sending himself back in time to rule over ancient Rome as a god-king, but rather had ended up being sent back over 400 million years into Earth's past, where he would rule over nothing.]
