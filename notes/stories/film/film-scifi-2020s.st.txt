fear for one's life [Miya was at one point alone and in mortal terror of being eaten by sharks.]
unethical business practices [It turned out that the big pharma company that'd employed Richard and Lucas to kill the last remaining intelligent sharks was motivated by a desire to protect their patents and stock price.

speculative genetic engineering [It was mentioned how a pharmaceutical billionaire had genetically engineered a bull shark to be intelligent.]
