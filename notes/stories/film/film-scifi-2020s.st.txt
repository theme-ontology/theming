old flames [Richard was revealed to be Emma's ex-boyfriend from their grad school days, and the two quarreled like in days of old throughout the film.]
global warming [A recurrent topic in the film is that climate change is already happening, and that it is perhaps too late to stop it.

Also Lucas was of the mind that the world was going to hell because of climate change and the best thing to do was to make as much money from it as you could.]

coping with the death of a friend [Emma pointedly mourned the death of her longtime friend and colleague, Shaw.]
fear for one's life [Miya was at one point alone and in mortal terror of being eaten by sharks.]
unethical business practices [It turned out that the big pharma company that'd employed Richard and Lucas to kill the last remaining intelligent sharks was motivated by a desire to protect their patents and stock price. This was controversial because killing the sharks would mean that a cure to Alzheimer's disease would be lost with them.]
speculative genetic engineering [It was mentioned how a pharmaceutical billionaire had genetically engineered a bull shark to be intelligent.]

torture [A Russian (or perhaps Ukrainian) mercenary tortured the Protagonist with a pair of pliers.]
suicide [The Protagonist ingested a suicide pill while being tortured. Upon being revived, he learned that it was not really a suicide pill and that the whole scene had been staged to test his loyalty.]
