telegraph service in 1861. Conflicts arise between the man and his former
gang, as well as between the team stringing the wires and the Native Americans
through whose land the new lines must run. In this regard, the film is not
historically accurate; Edward Creighton was known for his honest and humane
treatment of the tribes along the right of way and this was rewarded on the
part of the Indians by their trust and cooperation with Creighton and his
workers. The installation of telegraph wires was met with protest from no one.

series Colt .45 seven years later., starring Wayde Preston. Written by Thomas
W. Blackburn, author of the lyrics to The Ballad of Davy Crockett, the film is
about a gun salesman and gunfighter who tracks down a killer who stole two new
Colt .45 repeating pistols leaving a trail of dead bodies behind him. The
revolvers used in the movie were actually first model .44 Caliber Colt
revolving belt pistols made in 1849 and reaching final form by 1850. Scott
correctly demonstrated how to load them so the producers of the film were most
likely aware of the anachronism in the title.

storyline of an established master of her craft being usurped by a younger,
ruthlessly ambitious underling, who then years later finds the same thing
happening to her â with a waspish male critic on hand throughout to provide a
steady stream of acerbic, biting commentary â led inevitably to the film being
dubbed the All About Eve of the fashion world.

French Cancan is a 1955 French-Italian musical film written and directed by
Jean Renoir and starring Jean Gabin and Francoise Arnoul.  Where Renoir's
previous film Le Carosse dâor had celebrated the 18th-century Italian commedia
dellâarte, this work is a homage to the Parisian cafÃ©-concert of the 19th
century with its popular singers and dancers. Visually, the film evokes the
paintings of Edgar Degas and the Impressionists, including his own father,
Pierre-Auguste Renoir. It also marked his return to France and to French
cinema after an exile that began in 1940.
