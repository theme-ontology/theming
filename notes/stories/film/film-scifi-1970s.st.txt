H. G. Wells' The Shape of Things to Come is a 1979 Canadian science fiction
film. Although credited to H. G. Wells, the film takes only its title and some
character names from The Shape of Things to Come, Wells' speculative novel
from 1933. The film's plot has no relationship to the events of the book. The
book predicts events such as a Second World War and the collapse of social
order until a world state is formed, whereas the film involves a high-tech
future involving robots and spaceships. The film was an attempt to capitalize
on the popularity of such recent successes as Star Wars, Starcrash, and TV
series such as Space: 1999 and Battlestar Galactica, although the film had
only a fraction of the production budget of any of these.
