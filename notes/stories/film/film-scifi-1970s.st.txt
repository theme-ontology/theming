After a violent storm at sea, the inert body of a man is found on the beach
near the Naval Undersea Center. Equipped with webbed hands and gills instead
of lungs, he can breathe underwater, swim faster than a dolphin and dive to
depths of at least seven miles. He is nursed back to health by Doctor
Elizabeth Merrill and given the name of Mark Harris. In return, Mark agrees to
help the United States Navy recover a lost missing submarine carrying top
military officials. Deep in the ocean, Mark discovers an enormous undersea
habitat constructed by Mr. Schubert, a maniacal scientist who has gained the
assistance of kidnapped scientists from various nations via mind-control
bracelets and plans to destroy all the nations of the world with their own
nuclear weapons. Mark foils this plan by flooding the undersea habitat and
helping the scientists escape, although the fate of Schubert is unknown. He
decides to return to his aquatic life but, when reflecting on his recent
encounters with humans, returns to a delighted Dr. Merrill, declaring, "I have
not yet learned enough."

:: Description
H. G. Wells' The Shape of Things to Come is a 1979 Canadian science fiction
film. Although credited to H. G. Wells, the film takes only its title and some
character names from The Shape of Things to Come, Wells' speculative novel
from 1933. The film's plot has no relationship to the events of the book. The
book predicts events such as a Second World War and the collapse of social
order until a world state is formed, whereas the film involves a high-tech
future involving robots and spaceships. The film was an attempt to capitalize
on the popularity of such recent successes as Star Wars, Starcrash, and TV
series such as Space: 1999 and Battlestar Galactica, although the film had
only a fraction of the production budget of any of these.
