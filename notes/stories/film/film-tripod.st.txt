compromising one's ethical principles for personal advantage [The vulture capitalist Edward Lewis struggled with the decision of whether to coerce the owner of a shipbuilding company into a billion dollar acquisition deal that would see the company liquidated, leaving Edward with yet another dump truck full of money, but the company's employees without their livelihoods.]
wrestling with one's conscience [The vulture capitalist Edward Lewis had increasing qualms about coercing the warm-hearted grandpa owner of a shipbuilding company into accepting a billion dollar acquisition offer that would see the company utterly liquidated.]
seeing the error of one's ways [In the end, the vulture capitalist Edward Lewis had a change of heart about coercing the warm-hearted grandpa owner of a shipbuilding company into accepting a billion dollar acquisition offer that would see the company immediately liquidated.]
growing as a person [The callous vulture capitalist Edward Lewis learned compassion as his heart melted for the titular "Pretty Woman", Vivian Ward.]
