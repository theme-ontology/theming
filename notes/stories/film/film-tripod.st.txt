rise to prominence from humble beginnings [The story follows the street prostitute Vivian Ward as she finds in the wealthy businessman Edward Lewis her Prince Charming.]
prostitution [The story explores Vivian and her roommate Kit's lives as street prostitutes in Los Angeles.]

greed [The vulture capitalist Edward Lewis and his associate Phillip Stuckey had designs on forcing the garden variety capitalist grandpa owner of a shipbuilding company into accepting a billion dollar acquisition offer, after which they would liquidate the company and take the payout.]
compromising one's ethical principles for personal advantage [The vulture capitalist Edward Lewis struggled with the decision of whether to coerce the owner of a shipbuilding company into a billion dollar acquisition deal that would see the company liquidated, leaving Edward with yet another dump truck full of money, but the company's employees without their livelihoods.]
wrestling with one's conscience [The vulture capitalist Edward Lewis had increasing qualms about coercing the warm-hearted grandpa owner of a shipbuilding company into accepting a billion dollar acquisition offer that would see the company utterly liquidated.]
seeing the error of one's ways [In the end, the vulture capitalist Edward Lewis had a change of heart about coercing the warm-hearted grandpa owner of a shipbuilding company into accepting a billion dollar acquisition offer that would see the company immediately liquidated.]
growing as a person [One storyline follows the wealthy businessman Edward Ward as he transforms from a vulture capitalist of the most ruthless type into a regular capitalist.]

:: Minor Themes
roommate and roommate [Vivian was rooming with her fellow lady of the night, Kit, until taking up temporary residence in a fancy hotel penthouse. Vivian was dismayed at the revelation that Kit spent the rent money on drugs.]
friendship [Vivian and Kit were best friends and roommates.]
class prejudice in society [The street prostitute Vivian was told to leave a fancy Beverly Hills woman's boutique by its proprietor even though she had money to spend.]
table manners [Vivian was instructed in the difference between a salad fork and a dinner fork (among other things) prior to her night out at the fancy restaurant.]

:: Not Themes
loneliness [Vivian using the turn of speech "I was gettin' lonely upstairs all by myself" is not sufficient justification for applying this theme. Edward seeking out Vivian's companionship could possibly serve as a basis for motivating the use of "loneliness" in this story.]
