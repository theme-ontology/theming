- Generalize "asteroid impact" to "catastrophic impact event" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event).
- rename "attack from outer space by a powerful conquering alien race" to "alien invasion" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_invasion) and merge with related themes, like "attack from outer space by a genocidal enemy".
- check applicability of "helping a stranger in need" in tos/tng episodes

- Review "adolescence" since we've lost track of using this theme.

- Consider generalizing "trust in a friend" to something like "trust in another person"
- Consider adding "the desire for honor" as a "human aspiration".

	* ds92x05 Cardassians: PS thinks keeping secrets was probably not featured in the episode
	* ds92x18 Profit and Loss: PS thinks keeping secrets was probably not featured in the episode
