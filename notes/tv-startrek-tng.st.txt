Star Trek: The Next Generation

:: Description
Star Trek: The Next Generation (abbreviated as TNG and ST:TNG) is an American
science-fiction television series in the Star Trek franchise created by Gene
Roddenberry that ran from 1987 to 1994. Roddenberry, Maurice Hurley, Rick
Berman, Michael Piller, and Jeri Taylor served as executive producers at
different times throughout its production. The show was very popular, reaching
almost 12 million viewers in its 5th season, with the series finale in 1994
being watched by over 30 million viewers. The show spawned two reasonably
popular spin-offs set in the same sci-fi universe time and place, and four
movies with the cast of the show. In the early 2000s the show Enterprise,
although more oriented towards re-booting the series, was in the same
fictional universe, but set during an earlier time.

The series involves a starship named Enterprise and is set in the nearby
regions of the Milky Way galaxy, the Alpha Quadrant. The first episode takes
place in the year 2364, 99 years after the start of the five-year mission
described in the original series, which began in 2265.

(1) This is the perfect example of a bad episode. A futuristic setting is completely unnecessary to tell this story. Racism. (2)Their medical theory is obsessed with DNA.

:: Notes
1) A hilarious misunderstanding of dark matter is illustrated by Riker when he says "Let's light up this nebula." 2) Data misses an opportunity to use the Maltuvis device in the teaser when he talks about the romantic failings of King Henry VIII. 3) The realization just dawned on me that the model for Data is an autistic person. 1) Humans have "programs" running in their brains, too. 2) Why is she perpetually acting like Data should have emotions when she knows very well he does not? Does star fleet's “highest standards of quality” allow for complete morons on the flagship?
