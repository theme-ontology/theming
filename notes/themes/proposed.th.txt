emergently intelligent being
============================

:: Description
A non-human intelligence forms through some process akin to evolution. 
This is as opposed to it being designed by some prior intelligence.

:: Notes
In fiction there are many cases of machines that weren't meant to be 
intelligent, becoming so for one reason or another. That case is typically in
scope for this theme. The boundary becomes blurred when the machine was
originally designed to be advanced close to the point of intelligence.
