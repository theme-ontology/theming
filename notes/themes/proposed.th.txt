=======================================================

:: Description
Social stratification refers to a society's categorization of its people into groups

occupation, social status, or derived power (social and political). Featured is a
society that is more or less formally organized around one or more such principles.

:: Notes
The following are necessary requirements for the theme to apply: There must be a 
clearly identifiable grouping of the people in the society into (at least) two groups.
There must be laws or other relatively strong institutions that perpetuate that 
grouping. Said grouping must have significance for the way the society is governed.
