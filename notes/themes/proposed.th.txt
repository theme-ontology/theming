the technological singularity
=============================

:: Description
Featured is the idea that, at some point, AI will become more advanced than humans. 
At that point the AI will accelerate the development of even more advanced AI, and so on ad
infinitum. 
The result is that, pretty much in the wink of an eye, AI so far exceeds human capabilities that
it makes humanity obsolete and imperils human civilization's existence, or freedom to choose its own destiny.
