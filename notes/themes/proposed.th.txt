:: Notes
Any defined character relationship can be familial if it is clearly considered
as such in a story and if it is sufficiently relevant to the plot. It may be
noted that while there are many stories in which parental, sibling, half-
sibling, step-parent, sibling-in-law, or even adoptive relationships are
important, there are few stories in which consanguinity relations beyond first
cousinage is relevant to the plot.

:: Examples
"guardian and child" is a "human familial relationship" because the guardian
is typically expected to take on the role of a parent even if they are not
related to the child by blood.
