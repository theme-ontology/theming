sex-droid
=========

:: Description
There is a "fully functional" android of one gender or another, capable of pleasing its masters in matters of the flesh. Whether or to what extent such behavior should be
tolerated in society is topical. 
In practice, if the idea of sexual activity with a human-like machine is mooted in the story, this
theme can almost certainly be motivated since such any such goings-on would be generally be eyebrow-raising to an audience whether past- or present-day.
