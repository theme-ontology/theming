:: Notes
The theme is not used about specific and limited attributes a character may
feel, superior with respect to. For example, if a character rightly or wrongly
thinks they are better at the game of pool than others, this may rather be
called "pride in an ability", or perhaps "hubris".

coping with someone who is comporting themself above their station
==================================================================

and is troubled by the fact that character B behaves like they have a
