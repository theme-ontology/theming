:: Notes
The theme is not used about specific and limited attributes a character may
feel, superior with respect to. For example, if a character rightly or wrongly
thinks they are better at the game of pool than others, this may rather be
called "pride in an ability", or perhaps "hubris".

coping with someone who is comporting themself above their station

democracy vs. autocracy
=======================

:: Description
Democracy is a system of government in which state power is vested in the people or the general population of a state.
Autocracy, by contrast, is a system of government in which absolute power is held by the ruler, known as an autocrat.
In practice, systems of government aren't objectively either, but can subjectively
be placed somewhere on a scale between the two extremes.
Compared and contrasted in the story is two forms of government, one of which falls
further towards the democratic end of the scale and one who falls further towards the
autocratic end of the scale.
For example, in Ancient Rome the faults and virtues of the somewhat democratic Republican system
was compared and contrasted with the faults and virtues of having a mostly
autocratic dictator or emperor in charge.
