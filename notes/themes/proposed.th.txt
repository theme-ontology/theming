what if I came into a lot of money
==================================

:: Description
We, as people of more or less normal means, imagine what we would do with a
very large amount of money if it suddenly came into our possession.

what if my life were different

:: Notes
The threshold for this theme is that the amount of money is so large that the
person doesn't necessarily have to work more in their life, should they wish
it. If a smaller amount of money is suddenly gained, the theme "what if I
suddenly got some free money" applies instead.

The character has enough money to command the labour of numerous or countless fellow citizens, for example, through the vehicle of a private corporation.
