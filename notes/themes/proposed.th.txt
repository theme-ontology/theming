Alzheimer's.

what if I came into a lot of money
==================================

:: Description
There is a character of more or less normal means who comes into the possession of a
very large amount of money. The money is available for them to use.

:: Parents
what if my life were different

:: Notes
The threshold for this theme is that the amount of money is so large that the
person doesn't necessarily have to work more in their life, should they wish
it. If a smaller amount of money is suddenly gained, the theme "what if I
suddenly got some free money" applies instead.

The theme typically excludes scenarios where, for example, criminals have to conceal the money or are otherwise on the run from the police. In such cases they aren't really free to spend the money.


what if I was super rich
========================

:: Description
There is a character that is ostentatiously wealthy in the context of the society depicted. The character has enough money to command the labor of numerous or countless fellow citizens, for example, through the vehicle of a private corporation. In a modern story, they might have their own yachts, jets, and secret bat caves.
