history

:: Notes
If there is conflict between the nature of civilization in a story and the
time/location the story itself professes to take place, the nature of
civilization in the story should be used to determine which history theme is
relevant. The precise dating of these time periods is therefore of lesser
importance to the categorization of stories.

If the story is still ambiguous, do not expend energy debating the point but
include all seemingly applicable themes.

It is suggested to use these themes as Major only when the story clearly
depicts something that can be considered a reasonable image of normal life for
some relatively normal category of people. If the focus of the story is, for
example, a heroic figure doing something heroic then the social setting in
which it takes place may likely be a Minor theme, if a theme at all.
