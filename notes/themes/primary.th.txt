"murder" becomes topical if a murder is committed. Common sense is required
here: For example, action movies frequently feature actions that would
arguably be "crimes" to a thoughtful conscientious viewer, yet are not treated
as such in the story for one reason or another (action heroes often appear to
be above the law). It is not the purpose of this category to catalog such

spoke to only on the phone. The sentiment was reciprocated. Unfortunately, he

relationship", on the other hand, is a category of themes that most often
examine the interaction between two people and discuss both their experiences
simultanously. Likewise "humans in group" imply themes that examine the
constitution of a whole group of people, for example the idea that "lack of

There is a gray area around tool usage. Generally, if a character uses an
object that anyone could use then the tool in question is what is
extraordinary, and not the character's ability to use it. However, if the tool

:: Parents

:: Notes
This theme is considered to be topical, for example, if it is featured that a
living person dies and transitions to being a ghost as the idea that this can
happen when we die, is then implicit.

The theme is not otherwise applied in a story where there just appears to be
an incorporeal spirit, unless it is made explicitly clear that this is the
after-life existence that can occasionally happen to people.

In some stories there is a character that is the Grim Reaper, or similar.
Surprisingly often, nothing further is said about whence (if anywhere) he is
to escort the deceased. Thus "the afterlife" does not appear to apply.

In some stories, the deceased character appears to remain in the world briefly
for the purpose of relaying the story more than to suggest that this is a
possible continuation of their spiritual existence. Unless matters are
clarified further, we do not apply "the afterlife" as a theme.

shifted.
