:: Description
The crime of stealing from a bank (or comparable venue) by physically gaining
entry to its facilities and unlawfully removing large amounts of money or
valuables, is featured. Bank-like outfits include other venues that have
vaults, for example casinos or Fort Knox.

:: Parents
robbery

:: Notes
In real life most bank robberies are made at gunpoint, i.e., by threatening
bank employees with violence. In fiction (more than reality) there are
sometimes clever schemes to gain entry clandestinely, for example by tunneling
in during off-hours, or using deception. The latter is technically a case of
"burglary" when violence is not used, but is categorized as "bank robbery" for
convenience. This definition may well (and rightly should) be revisited in the
future.

:: Examples
In talesoftheunexpected5x06 "The Moles", two old friends whose business faced
financial ruin hatched a clever plan to tunnel their way into a certain bank
vault from an antique shop adjacent to it.

crime
=====

The action must be understood in the context of the story to constitute a

Because of their notoriety, we consider that a "crime" theme is topical to the
story when a character unambiguously commits such a crime. For example
"murder" becomes topical if a murder is committed. Common sense is required
here: For example, action movies frequently feature actions that would
arguably be "crimes" to a thoughtful conscientious viewer, yet are not treated
as such in the story for one reason or another (action heroes often appear to
be above the law). It is not the purpose of this category to catalog such
things.

:: Description
Destiny, or "fate", is the idea that some or all of what happens to us is
predetermined and cannot be influenced by our decisions. This idea is featured
in the story. It shouldn't be confused with the idea of (backwards) "time
travel" and usually isn't used in conjunction with the time travel theme.

:: Parents
folk belief

:: Notes
Typically, destiny is a major theme in stories where a character has been told
about their future through a prophesy or the like, and strives to change some
part of it (generally in vain). It is a minor theme for example when a
character mentions the idea but it has little relevance to the main storyline.
Note that words like "destiny" and "fate" are sometimes used in figures of
speech (say "come, destiny awaits" or "that fateful day") where the speaker is
not particularly concerned with the idea behind the word in question. In such
cases it is not used as a theme at all.

Time travel stories are most often paradoxical but tend to involve a character
actually changing what has, in a sense, already happened. In some stories a
character changes the past futilely in order to escape an event in the present
and it may in some sense look similar to the idea of destiny. However, it is
difficult to make sense of such stories in the context of "a singular
predetermined course of events", which is the basis for the classical idea of
"destiny". Therefore, as a rule of thumb, "destiny" stories tend to be
completely separate from "time travel" stories.

real or not (and thus the sanity of the character) itself is a central topic:
in this case the theme applies inasmuch the idea implied in the definition is
entertained as a possibility.

"Pride" themes like "attitude of superiority" involve a character comparing
themselves to others. Such themes do not necessarily mean that narcissism is
implied. It is possible for a character, rightly or wrongly, to believe
themselves superior and take pride in that supposed fact, without them
obsessively and lastingly admiring themselves.

To judge whether we describe a character as "narcissistic" we inspect the
character's self-admiring behavior and gauge whether we think that they, like
Narcissus did, could have behaved the same way when alone.

If a character admires themselves habitually but in a way that is not
describable as "obsessive" then the theme "vanity" is applicable.

Formal tests are typically associated with schooling, and thus the early

There is a gray area around tool usage. Generally, if a character uses an
object that anyone could use then the tool in question is what is
extraordinary, and not the character's ability to use it. However, if the tool
is uniquely connected to a user then arguably this user has an extraordinary
ability. Due judgment must be exercised, and this category may be refined as
we go forwards.

This theme is considered to be topical, for example, if it is featured that a
living person dies and transitions to being a ghost as the idea that this can
happen when we die, is then implicit.

The theme is not otherwise applied in a story where there just appears to be
an incorporeal spirit, unless it is made explicitly clear that this is the
after-life existence that can occasionally happen to people.

In some stories there is a character that is the Grim Reaper, or similar.
Surprisingly often, nothing further is said about whence (if anywhere) he is
to escort the deceased. Thus "the afterlife" does not appear to apply.

In some stories, the deceased character appears to remain in the world briefly
for the purpose of relaying the story more than to suggest that this is a
possible continuation of their spiritual existence. Unless matters are
clarified further, we do not apply "the afterlife" as a theme.

tng5x24 "The Next Phase", before finding out that they had merely been phase
shifted.

are innately linked in a hive mind or the like.


what if I became witness to a crime

We imagine what it would be like to see something that seems to imply a
serious crime, typically murder, has been committed. Typically we are left to
ponder what one should do: Should we investigate, contact the police, or drop

In "Rear Window" (1954) Jeff thinks he has just witnessed a murder but doesn't
have enough certainty to call the police. Instead he convinces his friends to
sneak over and gather evidence.

==================================

:: Description
There is a character of more or less normal means who comes into the
possession of a very large amount of money. The money is available for them to
use.

:: Parents
what if my life were different

:: Notes
The threshold for this theme is that the amount of money is so large that the
person doesn't necessarily have to work more in their life, should they wish
it. If a smaller amount of money is suddenly gained, the theme "what if I
suddenly got some free money" applies instead.

The theme typically excludes scenarios where, for example, criminals have to
conceal the money or are otherwise on the run from the police. In such cases
they aren't really free to spend the money.


what if I caught a glimpse of the future
========================================

:: Description
A character is shown a sight of some future happening. This might be on
account that the character invoked a magical incantation, appealed to some
speculative technology, or was shown a vision of the future by another entity.

If a character has an innate ability to see into the future, then

a cantankerous room mate found out from a couple of time travelers hiding in
her wardrobe that she was, in fact, destined to become the future leader of a

with no realistic possibility of escape in tas 1x12 "The Time Trap".


what if I could only speak the truth
====================================

:: Description
There is a character who is physically unable to tell intentional lies.

:: Parents
speculative experience

:: Notes
This is one of the more-or-less incoherent counterfactuals that appears in
stories: A circumstance arises in which a character tries to speak a lie
(maybe a white lie or omission of the truth), but their mouth ends up uttering
the truth (maybe the whole truth) to the mind's general dismay. The theme
notably does not apply if a character merely chooses not to tell lies, be it
for moral compulsion on legal injunctions.

:: Examples
In tz1959e2x14 "The Whole Truth", the crooked, used car dealer Mr. Hunnicut
came into the possession of a haunted car that somehow made him tell the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. This proved disastrous for
his business.

==================================================

:: Description

:: Examples
Sulu couldn't tell whether those were swirling knives out there in space while

Shall Lead".
