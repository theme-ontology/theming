:: Description
Struggling comedian Samir Wassan meets legendary comic J.C. Wheeler, who
advises him to include personal material in his routines. After doing a
successful routine centered around his dog, Samir returns home and discovers
that not only did his dog vanish, but no one seems to remember that it ever
existed. He then learns that jokes about the people in his life get laughs,
but cause them to disappear from existence. After accidentally erasing his
nephew, Devin, Samir starts erasing people he thinks the world would be better
off without. His girlfriend, Rena, leaves him after the erasing of David
Kendall causes her to go from a successful lawyer to a struggling waitress.
After another encounter with Wheeler, Samir continues abusing his power, going
so far as erasing rival comic Didi Scott. Rena confronts him during a set with
a journal containing names of those he's erased. Realizing what he has done,
Samir erases himself from existence while everyone previously erased exists
again. Didi, now a rising star, meets Wheeler following a set and asks for his
advice.

PTSD-afflicted journalist Justin Sanderson boards Northern Goldstar Airlines
Flight 1015 from Washington, D.C. to Tel Aviv after accepting a job offer.
Shortly before takeoff, Justin finds an MP3 player in his seat pocket and
discovers it contains a podcast hosted by Rodman Edwards revolving around "the
mystery of Northern Goldstar Flight 1015", which disappeared an hour into the
flight. As the podcast accurately describes events involving his fellow
passengers, Justin juggles controlling his nerves and confiding in Joe
Beaumont, a former pilot who seems to be the only person who believes him and
had lost his job for crashing a previous airplane. He tries using clues from
the podcast to avert the disaster, but every attempt results in irritated crew
and passengers. Joe then convinces Justin to help him gain access to the
flight deck so he can land the plane safely in Canada. The two accomplish
their mission, but Justin realizes from the podcast at the last minute that
Joe is responsible for the crash. Waking up on an atoll, Justin learns via the
podcast that everyone that survived was rescued months later while he is
considered missing. The other survivors appear, surround Justin from all
sides, and beat him to death as he claims that he was trying to save them.

Alaska police sergeant Yuka Mongoyak arranges for her brother, Jack, to be
pardoned at Captain Lane Pendleton's annual Christmas party, which she
detests. At the height of the festivities, Yuka discovers another inmate has
mysteriously appeared in the station's holding cells. The stranger, whose name
is "legally" A. Traveler, claims he is an extreme tourist who has heard of
Pendleton's "famous" parties. As Traveler becomes friendly with the guests,
Yuka grows suspicious of his identity. Pendleton soon grows suspicious when
Traveler reveals information he should have no way of knowing like the actions
done by Mayor Matheson. When Yuka, Jack, and Pendleton spot antennas on
Traveler's head, Traveler deflects their suspicions by claiming Pendleton is
in league with the Russians. Pendleton then leaves to check on the shed
powering the town while Traveler promises Yuka that she will be in charge and
that "[his] people" will come and take over. Yuka proceeds to corner Pendleton
and hold him at gunpoint as they witness UFOs descend from the sky. At the
