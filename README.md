# Welcome to the Theme Ontology Community

A community-based, open access knowledgebase of literary themes and thematically annotated stories. 

## About

The Theme Ontology Project is a community-based undertaking that is focused on developing a literary thematic knowledgebase to underpin computational analyses in fiction studies.
This project repository contains a collection of carefully defined [literary themes](https://github.com/theme-ontology/theming/wiki/What-is-a-Literary-Theme%3F) together with thematically annotated [stories](https://github.com/theme-ontology/theming/wiki/What-is-a-Story%3F).
The themes are organized into a [hierarchy](https://github.com/theme-ontology/theming/wiki/What-is-Literary-Theme-Ontology%3F).
The package [py-totolo](https://github.com/theme-ontology/python-totolo) is used to interact with it programmatically.

The ontology can be downloaded and analyzed in various ways.
This tells us interesting things about the kind of stories we humans invent.
Theming is also a good personal way to reflect on what really goes on in the stories we enjoy.

Visit the Theme Ontology website: [https://www.themeontology.org/](https://www.themeontology.org/) to browse the data.
